I'll bring a lot of that back to my face-to-face classrooms to supplement the labs I usually do.  I also broke my 63-student class into quarters and had each quarter work with a single one of my assistant instructors (three graduate TA's and one undergraduate learning assistant) for the entire semester in an attempt to build relationships between students and assistant instructors.  I will also bring that strategy back into my face-to-face classroom."

Inevitably in face-to-face there would be cross-talk between student groups at the same table.  In teaching online I used Zoom breakout rooms which are completely separate, which killed all of that useful eavesdropping.  Student engagement was uneven to say the least, some students just wouldn't interact or unmute, and it was impossible for me as the instructor to assist unless groups asked for help.  Some groups wouldn't work together at all, and left before the end of class or completing the in-class work.  For substituting for their in class presentations, each group had to film a video of them going through their solution, which was a ton more grading.  There was a lab component for this course which was done with iOlab devices augmented with some simulations.  I made that asynchronous and every single issue of using computer data acquisition that we would have had in class, we had with individuals.  Comparing learning gains from a year ago (100% face-to-face) to this fall (100% virtual) showed a decrease in learning gains, though not a huge margin.  This might have been easier with a far smaller class, even though I had the assistance of 3 TAs and an LA, there were still 13 groups of 4-5 students."

Instructors and undergrad learning assistants work with small groups on activities followed by entire class discussions. We moved the in person version of this online using Zoom and break out rooms. We mostly kept the same activities and content, but overall went slower and had to cut here and there.

1) We observed far more heterogeneity of student situations and ability to participate effectively. 
2) Our students are missing technology that could help greatly with online synchronous group work - tablet + stylus gear. The students with that gear seemed to participate much better.
3) Our final exam scores for both spring and fall did NOT correlate as expected with semester performance or other grades. The value of the exams was questionable.
4) While we assigned regular grades, I wonder what they mean compared to usual. I don't think they carry the meaning the usually do.
5) Everything online was slower than in person - more friction. All progress was slower. 
6) Lab components were very difficult to implement online.
7) While student attendance was high, participation was much lower than usual."

It is hard to figure out how to modify in-class activities without spending excessive time on everything associated with running - everyone is tired of the excess amount of time everything takes.

I did not add a number of things, like backward design or the importance of metacognition, which I think would be considered already a best practice in f2f classes. If I added something like that here, I tried to highlight what about that practice is implemented different or more important in the online setting. 



Effective Practices

1.	Flexibility
a.	Due dates
i.	Not only an assignment here or there but even for systemic changes for individual students. A student may be in the field for multiple weeks, unable to engage at all, but when they return they can focus more intensely. 
b.	Engagement modes
i.	I cover this more in the section Multi-mode learning
c.	Assessment – Providing a number of ways to engage also means providing a number of ways to assess. Some students may be able to make synchronous group meetings or lectures while others are not. Allowing them the ability to engage and be assessed in multiple different modes ensures the flexibility required for distance learners.  
i.	Participation
ii.	Labs
iii.	Homework
iv.	Exam types
v.	Exam delivery methods
d.	Cheating – I didn’t know exactly where to put this but since increased flexibility can result in more opportunities to cheat, I put it here. 
i.	Most students are opportunistic cheaters, meaning they set out to cheat, they just found an opportunity to do so that is easy. Small policies and practices can go a long way to prevent the majority of students cheating. 
1.	Have students sign an honor code for every high/mid stakes event. Make them read it each time by planting a unique statement that must recall before signing. 
2.	Consider removing all high-stakes events. The reward has to outweigh the risk.
a.	It’s also much hard to systemically cheat many smaller events (quizzes or exams). 
3.	Consider using physical proctoring centers. This is the most secure but may create additional cost for the students and extra organizational work. 
4.	Consider online proctors like ProctorU. There is a gradient of security. On one end you have systems simply recoding their cams for you to watch later. On the other end the system completely takes over the student’s computer and there must be multiple cameras connected. A human may be watching live. These services can be just as costly as physical proctoring centers. 

2.	Multi-mode learning opportunities (maybe this belongs under flexibility)
a.	Synchronous – PER supports a number of models that all include some form of guided peer learning. Students work in groups with instructional staff available to guide the work and discussions. Studio physics is one example. This is more effective in real-time. I encourage departments to offer more real-time engagement opportunities as it is more efficient, more effective, and helps foster community. Students feel more supported when they can talk with their instructors and peers. These sessions should not be required and/or alternative asynchronous options should be available to students that can’t guarantee their schedule. 
i.	Many activities are well suited for a synchronous virtual classroom
1.	Studio-style problem solving sessions
2.	Group lab work
3.	Recitation-style smaller classroom sessions
4.	Real-time tutor support
b.	Asynchronous – Part of being flexible for students with non-traditional schedules means offering Asynchronous options and/or facets of your course. If these are alternatives to synchronous assignments/events they should provide as equivalent an experience as possible. 
i.	Some work can be better suited for asynchronous engagement 
1.	Homework – largely already implemented asynchronously
2.	Larger/longer projects
3.	Peer review of homework, lab reports/notebooks, exams, etc. 
4.	Reflective and meta-cognitive writing
c.	Blended/hybrid
i.	The benefits and best practices shared here can also be relevant to traditional students. I encourage replacing/supplementing some traditional learning time with online activities. Flipped classrooms where content delivery is moved online is one small example. Be careful not to simply add work. If you want engage students in an online activity, consider removing some other component. This could be removing a lecture to carve space for the new mode of work/collaboration. 
d.	Project-based
i.	Taking class online can create new opportunities such as longer/larger project-based activities. These tend to fit students who need asynchronous activities but it doesn’t only have to be asynchronous. There can be both synchronous and asynchronous aspects of the activity. It can be group/team based and those interactions can be in real-time or spread out of many days. It’s important to make both options available and try and form groups based on preferred engagement method. 

3.	Organization
a.	Clear roadmap – Without regular f2f meetings with peers and instructional staff, online students need everything to be more organized and clear. Distance learners tend to engage with class resources such as the syllabus more frequently. If the path to mastery is not laid out clearly, they have a harder time navigating the curriculum.  
i.	Calendar – centralized and integrated with learning platforms wherever possible. 
1.	Consider having one page (or calendar) with links to all assignments, study resources, and learning platforms. Organize by clear compartmentalized learning modules in a chronological order. Students tend to not draw boundaries based on content but rather by time. Even if you design to natural content breaks, present the outline to students along timeline breaks, like weekly or biweekly modules. 
ii.	Compartmentalized modules – It’s important to break the class into small digestible chunks that students can use to plan their time more carefully. Having multiple weeks where the topic is covered by many chapters in a traditional textbook, and one large homework due multiple weeks later, leaves more room for students to unknowingly fall behind. 
1.	Weekly or smaller is preferred. I find two or three modules a week to be ideal. 
b.	Use of a Learning Management System (LMS) – Most universities have a campus-wide LMS that students use in all their classes. Leverage this tool as it is where most students are used to basing their classes out of.
i.	Every assignment, from reading, to homework, to lab, to even exams, should be setup as an assignment with a due date, even if they don’t turn the work into the LMS. This puts everything in one calendar and students use that for alerts on what is due. It’s fine if they then upload it to some grading software or something else, just as long as it’s in the LMS calendar.  
c.	Centralized platform for all links
i.	Online classes usually require a host of specialized learning software, especially in STEM courses like physics. Examples include: LMS, grading software like Gradescope, clicker software, online textbooks, Zoom, OneNote, homework systems like Masteringphysics, Peer-review software like Peerceptive, Excel, Tracker, Pivot interactives,… and the list goes on and on. Make sure all of those are organized and findable from one central location, like the LMS. Students express overload when there are too many platforms but that frustration is highly mitigated if there is a central location of links. 
ii.	Be wary of specialized learning tools creep. It can be tempting to use the best piece of software for every little aspect and in the end students are engaging with 10+ programs.
1.	Consider the length of the course when deciding about what platforms to use. If it is a single class, creating a high barrier to entry may not be worth it. If it’s a year-long sequence, and the plethora of tools is worth it, it can be more acceptable to expect the extra time to learn all of the pieces in the system. 
d.	Proper training on each software platform – don’t assume that because your students are distance learners that they already “get” software and computers. Distance learners tend to span a wider range of age groups and a wider range of technical knowledge than traditional students.
i.	Syllabus quizzes that block new content until completed at the start of the term can be effect. Along with questions that encourage them to read the syllabus, they can have tasks that help teach them the learning tools that are to be used in the class. Examples include scavenger hunts for content, requirements to login and register software, and even test runs on things like uploading lab/homework/exam assignments. Expect to spend extra time on this step with online learners to ensure stress is decreased during the term. Students struggling to upload an assignment because of technical issues experience high levels of unnecessary stress.
ii.	You might also consider a small training on file directory structure and consistent file naming conventions.  
e.	Notetaking/organization software – with everything in digital format it is important to encourage students to adopt their preferred notetaking software. Examples include OneNote or Evernote. 
f.	Tablet – physics requires solving questions by hand, typically with pen and paper. When everything is turned in digitally that results in an additional step to make a digital copy. Using a tablet skips that step and ensures the writing is still active content (unlike a static flattened pdf).
i.	Couple the tablet with something like OneNote and your students (and you) will be more organized. Consider publishing your homework, lecture templates, and other resources all through one platform like OneNote. 

4.	Budgetary considerations
a.	Instructional staff support per person increases – a common preconception is that online classes are cheaper to deliver. In reality the number of students that can be properly supported online by one instructor is much less then in traditional f2f settings. One way to understand this is when one student asks a question in a live lecture, the answer informs potentially hundreds of students that had the same question. Online these interactions tend to be more one on one this takes a tremendous amount of human resources. OSU’s Ecampus for instance, a distance learning program ranked in the top ten nationally, suggests a budget of 2 to 1. Meaning if a full load for an instructor in a traditional f2f class is capped at 200 students, that number would be 100 for online courses.  
b.	Everything takes 30% longer – I made up that number but almost every online teacher laughs and fully agrees. Online learning is not a path to efficiency. 
c.	Lab kit costs – If your learning outcomes for lab include hands on activities that require purchasing a prepared lab kit, those costs can add up quickly. This is of concern for the already heavily financially burdened student base. I can also be a problem for the department if they have foot the bill upfront before the students make their purchase. There are companies that put kits together but they tend to have very high overhead costs. 
d.	Online proctoring – Can be effective to reduce cheating but also costs the students significant money, upwards of $45 per event. 
e.	Open Educational Resources (OER) – If all the engagement is already online, I suggest going one step further and using digital OER to cut costs. The publisher’s textbook is not as valuable as most think and the majority of students do not find the resource useful and end up Googling things anyways. Stop the cycle, go OER. Okay that was my unabashed plug for OER… just as relevant to f2f classes  

5.	Community
a.	Creating a vibrant inclusive community where everyone feels supported and owns their role is the most important aspect of any class. This becomes exceedingly challenging in the online environment. You have to get creative and approach the issue from a number of different directions. This is your biggest challenge!
b.	Learning Assistants (LAs) and TAs – It is best to have a multi-level support system for your class that leverages the strengths of the various members.
i.	LAs provide near peer that is unique to any other role in the team. Students feel far more comfortable asking questions they feel could be perceived as dumb or invalid to LAs than to TAs and instructors. LAs can manage the professional social media platform and help answer all those little questions that tend to fill an email box. They can also help in a number of other ways such as: fielding questions in synchronous/asynchronous events, holding study sessions, providing formative feedback on assignments, organizing and facilitating group learning, providing non-class-specific support like directing them to other university resources, and general community building. I can’t stress enough the importance of their role in any class. They are best return on investment you can find in my opinion. 
ii.	TAs typically know the physics better but are farther removed from the students. They are often grad students that never attended UG at that institution. As a consequence they may know less about the life of their students than the LAs. Use TAs as the first line of defense on supporting physics content.  
c.	Professional social media platform – a digital study room where students can come together to ask questions that LAs, TAs, instructors, and fellow students can collectively answer.
i.	This can be a message board service through an LMS but the functionality of such systems can be limited.
ii.	One suggestion is to use a platform more ideal for this type of engagement. Something that allows spontaneous real-time audio/video conferencing. Something with integrated digital whiteboards. Examples include Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Discord. 
1.	Check that your usage doesn’t violate FERPA. Discord is so open it is hard to maintain privacy. But it is a platform many students are already on… 
iii.	It’s important to differentiate this from other forms of communication. One suggestion is to use the social media platform for physics questions and questions about the working of the class. Things that everyone can help answer so that the burden isn’t only on the instructor. Leverage the community. Other questions about grades or administrative stuff should still be left to email so that there is a clear record and privacy is maintained. 
d.	Communication – Students need to know they are supported and the first step in that process is open and clear communication. When everything goes online you quickly learn the value of small f2f interactions. These can still occur in the online environment but they looks and feel different.
i.	Availability – your students need interaction with peers and instructional staff. You must make these human resources readily available.
1.	Clearly stated boundaries are important as they serve as guidelines for students. State when each member is available and the best mode to connect. Be careful of boundary creep where students expect too much of your time.  If you have to miss that time, make sure that is communicated to your students as soon as you know your absence. When possible give an alternative contact such as a TA or LA.
2.	Consider a contract that both you and your students agree too. An example is that from Monday through Friday you will respond to any question within 24 hours. You could go even further and expect that during that same time period students are expected to check their messages (email, Slack, message board).
ii.	Checking in your students – it’s important to check on your students at the very least once a week. Consider a traditional f2f class that meets 3 times a week. That 3 times a week you “check in” on your students. It may not be in practice a meaningful check in but it feels like one to the student, especially when there is formative assessment (like clicker questions) associated with class. 
iii.	More is better than less – error on the side of too many announcements or check ins. 
iv.	Fun videos telling them you’re thinking about them – you need to humanize yourself to your students. One way of doing this to send little videos showing the human side of your life. An example is to take a short ~1 min video with your phone while your digging in the garden and to tell the students you’re thinking about them and all the hard work they are doing on their upcoming report or assignment. 
v.	Tone – with a lot of communication moving to text and/or video, spend extra time ensuring the tone of your voice is welcoming and inclusive. Many students already fear their instructors and they may read what you write to mean something you never intended. 
e.	Group/team learning – There is a gradient of collaborative work with groups on one end and teams on the other. I won’t try and define what constitutes team-based learning from group-based but ways that they can be differentiated are analyzing the scope/time of the project, how many people are working together, whether there are formal roles, and whether the people have/will develop lasting relationships. 
i.	Synchronous
1.	Virtual breakout rooms (like in Zoom) can be used to allow collaboration like that in a Studio Physics classroom. 
a.	Getting students to talk and contribute can be the biggest difficulty. Defining roles, like someone dedicated to sharing their screen with the content everyone is working on visible, can help keep communication flowing. 
i.	Other roles can be defined and those can rotate through students. Scribe, equipment operator (like in a lab), presenter, skeptic, are examples of roles.
ii.	LA/TA support can really provide leadership in these sessions. 
b.	Most digital whiteboards allow exporting the work as an image. 
c.	Students should have at the very least a computer with a camera and microphone. 
2.	Clear session objectives – everyone needs to know goals and what product they are to be producing. 
ii.	Asynchronous
1.	Can be inefficient but provides the most flexibility
2.	Time delay between replies can be problematic
3.	Can be an advantage for longer/larger activities

6.	Lab goals
a.	Experimental design
b.	Data analysis
c.	Communication skills
i.	Collaborating on experiments can be difficult asynchronously
d.	Inquiry-based vs. prescribed labs
e.	Physical experiments vs. virtual experiments
f.	Project-based labs

7.	Accessibility 
a.	I like this being a main effective practices even though it could fit under flexibility because it highlights the importance. If someone decides to use UDL guidelines to make an online course they are likely to realize how their traditional class could be more accessible
b.	Universal design for learners (UDL)

The class is small (12) so I brought them back to campus after four weeks.  Normally there is a lot of interaction because we incorporate labs and problem sessions into the two hour thrice a week meetings.  Not in this case, however.  The distancing and mask requirements made doing labs almost impossible and the students barely interacted with each other during problem sessions.  The only advantage was I could lecture live (even though I had recorded every lecture ahead of time just in case) and the students could ""see"" each other live.  The main advantages to studio format were completely lost.  In a sense, I kind of regretted hauling them all back to campus, even though I know they didn't like Zoom.  As far as labs went, I preferred the virtual ones (and spreadsheet calculations they did on electrostatics) to the live circuit labs.  Why?  Your natural instincts take over when you teach for 30 years and it was all I could do to maintain distancing when I was helping them with labs.  It really wasn't worth it because it was more risk than it should have been.  This coming semester I have 16 in the class and there is no way I'm going to meet with them in a room on campus.  The Covid case count is too high and I'm 64 almost 65 years old.  I'm not taking any chances this time around.  I'll think about going back to campus if and when we all get vaccinated.  Until then, we can Zoom.  One perk about Zoom though, the students could Zoom with me any hour of the day if they had questions.....and they did.  Bottom line: Teaching in person with the pandemic restrictions in place really isn't much fun, and it's nothing like teaching in a normal setting.  Most of my Physics colleagues had classes that were too large to meet face to face, but I told them they were not missing anything.  It will be far more fun when we can teach ""normally"" again."

The students simply did not adapt well to the new format in the Spring, and in the Fall more of them knew what to expect. However, in both cases it was plainly evident that some students had more difficulties engaging with the material and participating in discussions compared to face-to-face settings. The two big hurdles I see are technological and psychological. Specifically, physics students need access to pen-based platforms (e.g., ipad or Surface) that they can use to write equations and sketch - this is absolutely necessary for introductory physics. We also need a better video platform that allows for more seamless and organic small group discussions - Teams and Zoom are terrible at this. Students seem much less self-disciplined and able to recover from failure, even when courses are structured to accommodate that. Failure is a critical component of learning, but the culture's obsession with performance and grades is increasing, and makes a growth-based mindset difficult to foster."

1) Importance of creating and sustaining social connection within the class community.  This includes getting to know students, letting them get to know me, providing opportunities for them to get to know one another, responding to email promptly and in-depth, checking in with students about ""how things are going"", etc. 
2) Be flexible regarding course deadlines.  Display compassion for students who are struggling to meet course deadlines.
3) Trust students.  I mean regarding academic integrity.  But also talk to them about that explicitly.  
4) Be more willing to explore informal connections of the course content to interesting but perhaps only tangentially related issues.  These include physics content from somewhat outside the scope of the course, current events, students' non-physics academic interests."

So my classes were better structured, but the amount of revision required (particularly for lab classes) was gigantic, so the end result was still quite rough. And student expectations were much higher in fall, as were the expectations of administration and the Board of Trustees (which liked to blame faculty for enrollment declines). While online was the right call, students were openly talking about dropping out (and some did drop out) because of the lack of face-to-face classes. We need politicians to understand that colleges are not like restaurants. It's sad if a restaurant closes during the pandemic, but restaurants close and open all the time. If a college fails, that's pretty permanent, and could leave an entire region without access to public higher education.

I think one of the primary things to understand is that students taking online by force are a completely different population than students who chose to take online before. So a lot of the ""best practices"" for online teaching were actually irrelevant junk, because they were designed for a different population. A lot of our students had taken online before, and explicitly rejected it in favor of F2F - until the option was taken away. (But my F2F classes couldn't be run during a pandemic, distanced and masked, even if we thought that were safe.)"

One advantage to Zoom teaching is that the students' names are shown, so I learn them more quickly.  Hands-on experimentation is all but impossible in this mode, and breakout rooms are only a limited substitute for small-group engagement in person.  Obviously it was easier to pivot hands-on activities (e.g. by making videos of the experiments and giving the students the data to analyze) in the fall when we had more lead time.  But inevitably the unstructured exploration that hands-on work fosters was missing.  Since my students were first-semester undergraduates, they really needed the opportunity to bond with one another and create community when they arrived on campus, and that was very difficult remotely.  Fortunately my students were all in the same time zone.  Although the class was mostly synchronous, I recorded the sessions in case somebody had internet problems.  One student skipped most of the synchronous sessions in favor of viewing the recordings, because he had to take a job to replace the work-study job he would have had on campus and the hours conflicted with our class time.  Needless to say, this did not help him succeed."

I initially felt it was not worth it but the second half of Fall 2020 I changed my mind and felt that the in person component of the hybrid class was critical for me and for the students.  I need a live audience.  Students who attended in person did better than those who attended online (I did a correlation analysis with their attendance style and their test scores).

After a few weeks I realized I could allow anyone to attend live that wanted to since many chose to just attend online."

Initially students either prospered (most of them), or foundered (a few of them disappeared after the first day).   Perhaps because of my reaching out, fewer than I expected seemed to check out emotionally.  They continued to actively participate and enjoy working together.  
I was surprised when near the end a significant number of students with whom I felt a good connection simply quit, - not taking -or not doing well on the final.  They were simply done, and no encouragement nor new opportunities enticed them. This group of  students was on track to do better than they might have formerly done in one of my face-to-face classes.   But these A or B students dropped two full grades over the last module of the course.  They constituted perhaps 6 to 8% of the class."

Although not as good as being face to face in a class, this worked quite well, the students were happy with it, and they did pretty well on the exams, so I would say it was a success. I do not think it was better than lecturing live, face to face, and as soon as we can I will return to that, although continuing to make recording of the lectures available to the students would be a good thing.

In contrast, in Spring I had planned well and just had to adapt the plan.  The last month and a half of Spring 2020 was rough, but I at least started in a reasonable place.  I started Fall 2020 behind.  A lot of non-essentials got dropped.  I actually did better with technology in Spring 2020 because fully online is a lot easier than having to set up all of the technology to manage a hybrid classroom.

That relationship is very weak when teaching completely remotely, as videos (except mine) are normally off for bandwidth.

During the summer and fall I found that the testing is the most difficult aspect of class management.  After finding my final exams completely on CHEGG with solutions coming back during the 3 hour test, I completely changed my testing strategy.  I give more tests with half the time, which is difficult for a number of students.  This is contrary to my belief that physics problem solving is not a speed issue, but I could not find a viable solution at this level.  Still Respondus is only partially a solution - good cheaters need less than 10 minutes on CHEGG using another device such as a phone, if the problem is somewhat close to a standard problem.

We all worked together to make the best of the situation.

I found it much harder to connect with the students I only knew from online instruction. Also the motivation of the students was lower in Fall 2020 and many seemed to have the intention of just ""checking the course off"" and having it done, rather then intending to actually learn. For example I had serious cheating issues in Fall 2020. 
I also had excellent academic support offered to my students using both TAs and PLAs as facilitators in study sessions. I found that only a small number of students made use of them (even though this small number did so every week)."

I knew that I was going to use Teams for synchronous lectures for my large intro physics class (54 students) with Top Hat to check on student understanding and to give them some practice with questions. For recitations, I figured out how to divide them into groups so that they could interact while working out problem on paper with TA support. That worked quite well on Teams. I used my TAs to proctor (and record) exams in breakout rooms on Zoom (which allows you to see a gallery of students better). That turned out to be less stressful for the students and more reliable than ProctorTrack (which suddenly shut down for several weeks partway through the semester). As with our face to face classes, we used our LON-CAPA online homework system for homework and pre-class assignments (as usual). We used the Creative Commons Open Stax University Physics as the textbook, as we have done for a several years. For Labs, I created Teams courses for each lab section and put the TAs in control of their section. Labs were a mix of videos of me doing the lab (these required the students to make readings of scales themselves from the videos) and PhETs (for situations like DC circuits where watching me do it would not be rewarding). The generation of the lab videos (and making sure that the closed captions were correct and accurate) was a *large* time sink (I was teaching the only section). My 4 TAs were very helpful."

Everything on Zoom takes longer (than in person).

Hybrid (some people in-person with other remote) is awkward at best. It is particularly difficult to maintain inclusivity for those who are online (particularly if they don't have their cameras on).  I didn't get much practice, though, as the University switched to remote only after the first week.

Things were also more difficult because although my kids got to go to school occasionally, they often got sent home when they got sick or a classmate or a teacher did. Having to provide childcare during the day and teach is really difficult. This is part of why I made my classes largely asynchronous, so that I could work at night after my kids went to sleep (good golly I've been burning the midnight oil). 

My university has been having COVID related retrenchment talks. That is why my job suddenly feels less secure than it did last year."

I learned that students appreciate opportunities to get involved in the class (a great tool was the classroom response system I used, Top Hat), and any opportunities I give them to feel a personal connection in the virtual classroom (synchronous teaching is very important). I also learned how much of a problem cheating is; many students consult online sources of information cheat without being fully aware that it is cheating."

That meant winging it one lab at a time, with no at-home equipment for students to use. It was a disaster.

I spent all summer redesigning the entire Intro Physics 2 w/Calc lab to focus entirely around electronics, and I designed, sourced, and assembled take-home lab gear kits for students to pick up (or, for a few, get mailed) at the start of the term. I designed every f*ng lab to be self-paced and self-guided, using massively hacked Google Sheets to guide students through setup, data collection, analysis, and reflection.

It was NOT a disaster, but it damn near killed me. I only got through about 70% of the planned labs, 'cuz I just couldn't roll out the actual curriculum fast enough.

Fortunately, my Department Chair let me opt out of teaching the intro lab again this spring. 😅"

In Fall 2020, I taught three courses which I had previously taught in person.  The prep for converting these three courses to hybrid/online was substantial and I would consider it to be equivalent to a new course prep. 

Another important aspect of my teaching in Fall 2020 which differed from Spring 2020 was that I converted an intro physics course which had been about 25% lecture and 75% groupwork when taught face to face into a hybrid or fully remote/synchronous format. Most of the faculty in my department did not attempt to reproduce the expectations for groupwork in online teaching of this course, but I decided to try.  I used breakout rooms in Zoom, which involved a lot of trial and error.  It would be great for there to be better documentation about how to use breakout rooms to best effect (e.g. how to assign breakout rooms in advance to keep group assignments the same, not opening the breakout rooms too early to prevent students from being unassigned, etc). Ultimately I believe that this format was successful and I had students tell me that the course was their best-organized online class.  

The biggest challenge I faced was integrity of exams.  Despite using the Lon Capa software to assign different numbers for all the students on the exam problems, there was clearly cheating occurring. I did not pursue this cheating with the honor council, but instead just to be very lenient with my grading for students who seemed not to cheat.  As a result, all my students in the intro class passed with a C- or above, which was the minimum allowed to have an opportunity to go on to the next course in the sequence.  Typically I have about 10-15% of my students in this course receive a grade below C-, requiring them to retake the course if they wish to progress. However, this semester I didn't feel confident penalizing students who failed exams because they refused to cheat when there was significant evidence of cheating among the others in the course."

I did nothing synchronous and held no mandatory remote classes (I only held remote office hours, which were optional for students). In the Fall 2020, we were required by the administration to hold hybrid classes, so 1 day a week I held a remote zoom class and the other day of class was in-person. Everything was synchronous so students needed to stay caught up on everything. I think my method in the Spring only worked well for students who are self-motivated, don't procrastinate, and maybe have an inclination towards physics. Those who struggled with physics and/or motivation probably really struggled with this format. I think the method in Fall 2020 helped to keep students on track more, but it was definitely more work for me to plan out every minute of every class since all classes were held live (whether remote or in-person)."

We had to improvise on a dime.  Spring break started normally but was extended ine week to give us (and the students) to get ready.  Fall 2020 was planned from the beginning to be online only.  I was more comfortable than most because I had taught an online asynchronous Conceptual Physics course (that I developed) for many years, and so knew many approaches and routines that were valuable.  Going online but synchronous was actually much easier than asynchronous.  But I will rejoice the day when we can go back in the classroom.  The students do perform better in a Asynchronous format than asynchronous because of two major factors: the regularity of the meetings helps keep them on task and, to my surprise, the fact that they can comment and participate by asking question without being “seen” ( camera off).  It reduces their unwillingness to be recognized in a classroom setting."

In Fall 2020, I was teaching our undergraduate advanced lab class.  The university allowed limited in-person instruction for Fall 2020 in cases like lab and studio classes, so our department head, chief lab instructor, and I developed a plan to maintain the critical in-person hands-on laboratory part of the class.  Lectures became pre-recorded asynchronous, and we made the original lecture time a second lab section and split the students between them, in addition to spreading out the lab stations so that there was only one per room.  The class was already organized through Blackboard for distribution of course materials and lab submission and grading, so nothing there had to change.  Pre-recording and editing lectures was more time consuming than I anticipated, so I did not finish recording all of the material I'd hoped to.  I did try a discussion feature in Blackboard but it didn't result in more student interaction so I dropped it.  I did make a Slack discussion board with various channels, but the students also didn't use that to talk to each other and mostly used it to ask me questions, so it wasn't useless but wasn't what I hoped it would be.  I presume that they had other channels to communicate with each other that I didn't have access to.  Zoom for office hours and final presentations worked well.  The students and I are all very comfortable with technology, so we didn't have any technical problems, just the challenges of what is already a difficult course combined with reduced chances for interaction."

Comparing to Spring 2020 doesn't work because the courses were completely different.  I did do a fully synchronous online course in Summer 2020 which prepared me for having a much better time with the online content of the course.  Office Hours seem to work better in a video chat environment.  However, online lectures, even with exact same content, were not as effective.  I also needed to do online testing.  What I found was that using Honorlock with tests in MasteringPhysics worked much better than directly using Canvas.  (More flexibility in the questions.)  In general, all students taking an identical exam online did at least one grade level worse.  (No evidence of cheating, although I can't say the same for what I tried in Canvas in Summer 2020.)  The classroom was set up for social distancing, otherwise the teaching was the same as previously.  Cameras were available for me to share and record the lecture."

About killed myself trying to keep up with posting materials (videos, labs). Student interaction suffered with totally asynchronous and learning how to handle proctortrack. Fall taught large sections again with two colleagues for 2001. Reused a lot of materials successfully. Course already had a fair amount of online assessment (pre-class, homework) on LON-CAPA. Fleshed out and reorganized to try to make weekly expectations more clear (for online). In Fall used TopHat for 'class time' engagement during synchronous Teams meetings (had already been using TopHat in normal lecture, PRS before that). We haven't done anything amazing trying to get students in large lecture classes to engage peer-2-peer more, but we have created a reasonably smooth course with clear expectations and support for those students seeking it. We benefited dramatically from experience late last spring and over summer. This spring 2002 is online as well and the format is reasonably consistent for students' sake."

I would not make grand pronouncements about online education until we try it after the pandemic. 

One other thing—and this is a positive—is that I had never imagined that everyone on my faculty, including those who care little for education, were actually forced to try something new. I had conversations about teaching from people I wouldn't expect because of this, and I think this was a tremendous opportunity for PER."

As a result, much more time was spent in Fall 2020 helping the students develop skills needed to engage effectively while learning from home rather than in a classroom. Spring 2020, in contrast, felt more like an exercise in training students in the use of technology. Because our remote classes were synchronous, we were able to maintain the general approach we used during normal in-person classes. The main challenge (for both the faculty and the students) was learning how to use technology to effectively duplicate as much as possible the in-person experience. That was the paradigm we used, at least... rather than adopt our methods for remote learning, we learned how to use available technology to approximate the in-class experience remotely."

First, Microsoft sells a computer, the Surface Book, with a detachable monitor so that it becomes simultaneously a tablet and a computer. Put the tablet down on your desk and write out your notes with stylus or keyboard, reattach it to the laptop, bring up Zoom, and you are ready for class. The second discovery is the Microsoft program OnNote for Windows 10. It does wonders to make your online scribbles intelligible. It can turn illegible handwriting into perfect text and then change its color or font size to suit.

I get all this from the Math Dept. at LBCC. Apparently it's old hat for them."

My normal policy of dropping lowest scores in various categories was a lifesaver.

Both students and I appreciated having day-to-day responsibilities for the students extremely organized and clear on our LMS. This made things easier for them, and made frequent communication with me about course minutiae unnecessary. I'm very glad I took the time to create extremely organized modules in my LMS."

We taught half of Spring 2020 online due to the pandemic's onset in mid March, so we already had a basic plan for transitioning to fully online for the fall semester. Fall 2020 was not taught during a state of emergency as the second half of Spring 2020 was, so I would certainly say that Fall 2020 was an improvement over March-May 2020 -- we were able to conduct recitations over Zoom, perform synchronous lectures, and assign homework in Fall 2020.
Teaching online, however, is inferior to teaching in person for a number of reasons:
-low morale among both students and instructors, partly due to high communication barriers compared to the ease of communication in a physical setting
-no personal connection to students (I don't think I even know what most of them look like or sound like), which makes them less willing to ask for help or interact
-poor internet connections sometimes make deadlines difficult to meet and meetings difficult to conduct
-students don't develop physical measurement-taking skills in the lab
-grading online assignments sucks

Assessment of student understanding might be the facet that was most modified from the in-person format. Paper exams require students to show their work and justify their answers using their own knowledge; because grading online assignments is a big old bummer, we've swapped to a multiple choice format for exams, which really lowers the effort bar. Students probably appreciate this -- that's partly why it was done, I think -- but it's not a good way to check for content retention or reinforce understanding. The amount of energy poured into an online class compared to its yield (both in student performance and in instructor satisfaction) is significantly reduced relative to the energy and yield of an in-person class, and I don't think you can change that, no matter how many swanky tools you implement."

I am a bit more lenient in exams and grading but not a whole lot. I am not sure I would not want to teach online one day more than absolutely necessary. Doing experiments online is not DOING anything. The students are watching a video, they are not doing anything. This is a big deficiency. 
After Covid, I hope colleges and universities show their sincere interest in education by setting  aside 2 days a week for an entire year where those interested students can come and DO experiments in the physics lab under the supervision of instructors for free. We call it ""come and do all the experiments you did not do while online"".  I volunteer my free services. Thanks."

Managing group work via breakout rooms was slow, clunky and awkward. In general, everything was slower and clunkier. But still I thought the class went well, and, based on surveys and evaluations, the students agreed."

Fall was hybrid.  Hybrid was more work, but it felt like we could use more of the 40 years of PER because it is mostly classroom based.  It seems like we need more research into synchronous remote instruction."
