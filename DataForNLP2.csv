Four Year Private College/University,Bachelor's,"Minority-Serving Institution,Urban Institution,Women's College",1,200 or more,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"Keep the videos short, keep extra example outside of the videos (having one in the lecture is fine but no more).
Instead of an hour long lecture, break it into 10-15 minute videos with side examples so the students don't get overwhelmed and so you don't get overwhelmed they get easily digestible videos and you don't put out an hour long editing nightmare."
Four Year Private College/University,Ph.D.,Urban Institution,1,101-200,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,3-4 weeks,NA,"It was very time consuming.
I believe it is the same difference as movies/TV/youtube is to live theater.
It provided a good tool for student learning."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Hispanic-Serving Institution,3,200 or more,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,0-2 days,NA,Horrible experience. I am seriously considering a career change.

Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Rural Institution,1,21-35,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,3-4 days,NA,"I was familiar with Zoom from video conferencing and everyone was encouraged to use the software for remote instruction. I already used Canvas for assignments and grading, so I just increased its use for the online class. I learned some new features of Zoom, like screen annotations, breakout rooms, polling, yes/no buttons, chat, recording, and sharing YouTube videos that I integrated into classes. I already taught by annotating powerpoint slides on a tablet, so it wasn't too big of a change to use Zoom. The biggest challenge was the lack of audience feedback, so I used the yes/no buttons to ask if people understood tough concepts and used breakout rooms to drop in on 2-3 students at a time when I assigned group practice problems so that I could get some conversational feedback."
Four Year Public College/University,Master's,Rural Institution,3,36-50,"I have taught fully online previously.,I have taught in a blended online/in-person format previously.",1-2 weeks,NA,Although I have taught online before I find it far inferior to a face-to-face class.  I would not have continued if not for the pandemic.  Now I will have to teach the entire fall semester online.  I am less inclined to seek fancy tools or an LMS and more concerned about making connections to students.
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Urban Institution,1,21-35,I have taught fully online previously.,0-2 days,NA,"Teaching online is helpful, and I am planning to incorporate it more. The problem is the lack of proper assessment tools - the students cheat. Pass/fail option allowed students with marginal/zero knowledge to pass my class, which normally would nor happen. Online teaching was not an issue - these students had poor performance before switching to online teaching."
Four Year Private College/University,Ph.D.,Urban Institution,1,21-35,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"My online class was the advanced physics laboratory.  A large point of the class is learning how to operate an experiment to obtain reasonable data that can be analyzed.  That is 50% of the class, the rest is report writing. The closure of campus was late enough that all the students had the data for two of the three experiments they normally do during the semester.  They had an option to do a third experiment with an informal report, or turn one of the two into a formal report (for example, to submit to a journal).  The oral report component of the class was eliminated.  

My experience suggests that this course cannot be offered without access to the campus and the laboratory. We were fortunate that most of the hands-on work had been completed at the closure.  If something on line were offered, it would be a different course.  There is no way around that."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,101-200,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"My transition to teaching online took a very simple approach: Do on Zoom and with a webcam what I was doing in person on the board. I found that this worked to some extent and was not a disaster, but in the future I will find more ways to communicate with the students to get them engaged, and to vary the pace and delivery. It seems to me that this is both more important than when teaching in person, and easier to do than expected."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Rural Institution,2,200 or more,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,5-6 days,NA,"In Large-enrollment courses (150+) with a single instructor (and maybe 2 LAs) it becomes difficult to assess students.  Without additional instructor capacity, hand-grading of assignments to give feedback to students becomes unreasonable, and no good resource exists to ensure that students aren't accessing things like Chegg during online exams (additionally, since students weren't submitting things like this before the transition, it didn't seem fair to switch how they were being assessed in the middle of the semester).  Things like the lockdown browser only go so far, and requirements that students have a webcam so they can be ""remotely proctored"" have huge equity concerns given the rushed nature of this, and even for the upcoming fall (have you SEEN the price of webcams lately?  They're sold out everywhere)."
Four Year Public College/University,Master's,"Minority-Serving Institution,Hispanic-Serving Institution,Urban Institution",3,101-200,I have taught fully online previously.,0-2 days,NA,"...the important part of the class was an asynchrnous teamwork element, and that became even more evident when we made the transition."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Urban Institution,1,101-200,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"My in person class is as interactive as I can make a large lecture class.  I use ConcepTests, lots of demos (and require the students to predict the results of the demos) and lots of simulations.  I would wander the class and engage students in 1-1 discussions during conceptests.  This interactivity was much more limited when teaching on-line.
Exams were particularly troubling, because there were not enough safeguards against cheating."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,21-35,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"I was teaching an upper-level core undergraduate lab course. Transitioning online was basically not possible -- the level of the experiments is not appropriate for student work at home, simulations, or virtual labs. I had originally planned to live-stream (and record) myself doing the experiments, but access to our campus was completely cut off, so that wasn't a possibility. If we have to (or choose to) teach online in the future, that may be a possibility, but any online teaching is a poor substitute for an upper-level lab course."
Four Year Public College/University,Bachelor's,NA,2,21-35,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"An important lesson learned by the entire department was that Chegg.com can be used in real-time to cheat on online exams. We found our unique test questions answered on Chegg with matching student solutions. In one of my classes, the transition was relatively easy as I was already running the class in a flip format with lecture videos, mastering physics for homework, iLearn, etc. The main transition was using Zoom for class meetings and to supervise online exams."
Four Year Private College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,200 or more,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"I have learned that I can provide recorded material to the student and work problems with them in ""face to face"" settings."
Four Year Public College/University,Bachelor's,Rural Institution,3,21-35,"I have taught fully online previously.,I have taught in a blended online/in-person format previously.",1-2 weeks,NA,I was already doing it for 20+ years.  It was abrupt bit the challenges were invigorating!  We have been working for ~3 years on an online BA in Physics.  This only empowers that.  My faculty (I'm chair) struggle with understanding the connection.  (sigh)
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,2,101-200,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,3-4 weeks,NA,"The places where I have excelled in the past center around student interaction and helping lead them in their learning.  These methods did not help me get the students to log in, or have better internet, or motivate them to do the things I was able to do with a good rapport.  I spent more time as a gate-keeper, and the skills of teaching took a back seat as I spent more and more time adjusting assignments and fighting with technology.  I feel students had a similar experience as the same effort on their part would less learning, as a larger percentage of time was spent on technology issues and not on the material itself.
"
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,101-200,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,3-4 days,NA,"I recorded video lectures using my laptop and posted them to youtube. It went OK. The grades were higher in the online part. I suspect some of the students cheated on the online exams. I found my exam questions posted on Chegg shortly after the exam. I also used a lot of Physics Girl videos to augment my lectures. Overall, the semester turned out pretty good, but I would rather teach face-to-face."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,51-100,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"Teaching synchronously, online caused some anxiety for the first few weeks, but then I settled in. Having to record the lectures as a backup option in case of students' technical difficulties also caused some anxiety, since it is much more likely that mistakes or embarrassing moments are forever recorded for posterity."
Four Year Private College/University,Ph.D.,NA,2,101-200,I have taught in a blended online/in-person format previously.,3-4 days,NA,Honestly I had seen it coming for about a month so started to make the changes.  The main challenge was the need for the student to have access to specialized computers and software to do their data reduction for the class.  Our CSR's had already been exploring VM's to let students reach the packages they needed from anywhere in the world. That took care of one aspect of the lab class.  The second part I totally had to modify.  The class required hands-on telescope time with our robotic research telescopes.  That kind of died with leaving school. For fall I'm looking at some modifications that could let the students have at least part of the experience.
Four Year Private College/University,Ph.D.,NA,2,21-35,I have taught fully online previously.,3-4 days,NA,"The transition wasn't that difficult since many of the resources were available online anyway (homework, turning in assignments, etc.). The main change was moving student contact time to Zoom and in-class discussions from small groups to Zoom breakout rooms.  The major challenge for both me and the students was the reduced face-to-face social contact. I also found that it took significantly more of my time to provide an effective online teaching/learning experience."
Four Year Private College/University,Ph.D.,Urban Institution,2,20-Nov,I have taught in a blended online/in-person format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"A lot of communication and understanding of students’ needs is required so not only do they not get stressed, but so you don’t get stressed, too. You’ve got to learn to accept imperfections and be honest with your students about the difficulty you are having while also acknowledging yhrr err it difficulties."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,20-Nov,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"I have small children and a full research program.  I had no child care for 5 weeks and struggled to maintain 30-35 hours/week when I could work.  I knew I had to limit my class prep time, which was a factor in my pedagogical choices.  I think it also made me particularly sensitive to similar challenges my students faced.  I saw too much focus in many of my colleagues on maintaining standards and preventing cheating and not enough on having some human compassion because our students are going through a lot.  I am creeped out by Respondus.  Students did not sign up to be video taped, let alone for a prof to change policies and mandate that they be video taped in their own home.  I think it's one thing if they knew at the beginning of the semester, but it's not fair to do that to students mid-semester.  I think it's better to accept some level of cheating."
Four Year Private College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,51-100,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,3-4 days,NA,White board was ineffective.  I had to type out all of the equations and imbed them in powerpoint
Four Year Public College/University,Bachelor's,NA,3,51-100,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"There was a massive amount of cheating in the on-line class.   I think that both myself and my institution need to better address the question of cheating in unproctored on-line classes.    This experience gives me a very negative impression of the academic integrity of on-line classes, unless some serious attempt to proctor is done."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,10-Jun,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,5-6 days,NA,"My class was a graduate seminar class on ""professional skills"" (networking, grant writing, career choices, CVs, ethics, presentation skills) and as such was easily transitioned to online.

I am also the department chair so I have observed some difficulties faculty in my department have experienced.  Namely, lack of student interest, lack of student technology at home needed for online courses, rampant cheating using Chegg, students unwilling to engage in the online format, the difficulty in giving synchronous classes, the almost impossibility of giving an upper division lab."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,2,20-Nov,"I have taught fully online previously.,I have taught in a blended online/in-person format previously.",5-6 days,NA,"The entire problem with a flipped class based approach is that the students don't have good skills to
attempt various things in an independent manner;  they actually need to be trained."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,2,21-35,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"I could never find the right technology to produce good recorded lectures from home (graduate course, lectures are recorded, scheduled lecture time is for questions and discussion). It is frustrating. It takes a huge amount of time, and I have become infinitely inefficient. I can't get any useful feedback from students -- the material is challenging and students seem much less willing to ask questions even though our meetings are specifically for that).  Attendance at lectures (question/discussion) is low, around 30%."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,51-100,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"What do you want to understand? Ask a couple of classes of students and 10 instructors, you will see what they think. The only ones who think this was great are the school administrators, because they think they might save money (as if we could compete with online colleges) and the sycophants who try to become the next deanlet by preaching  ""best teaching practices""."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Rural Institution,1,200 or more,I have taught fully online previously.,3-4 days,NA,"I honestly think those that are having more difficulties with teaching online were using more antiquated teaching methods (lectures, textbooks, not leveraging LMS, etc.). We have been teaching with a fully hybrid flipped classroom for years where the only difference between a f2f and online class is whether you're physically there or not. All resources, homework, and support were available online before this hit. We even had our online, hybrid, and f2f students attending the same synchronous lectures, interacting in breakout groups in a mixed form. We've had the option to attend or not by creating asynchronous assignments for a couple years. Our vision, which we've been working towards for about 5 years, was to offer a completely al carte model where you pick this week if you're going to attend lecture, lab, or recitation in person or engage remotely. We form groups to maximize diversity across all chosen paths.  For our class the transition was fairly smooth. The one place it has been difficult, and we are failing our f2f (remote) students, is labs. We have physical labs for the online students but those kits are expensive and take time to prepare so we didn't go that route for our f2f students who moved to remote learning. They are using simulations and there is evidence that they are not working as well as the online students who are doing physical experiments."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Rural Institution,1,21-35,I have taught in a blended online/in-person format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,Good in-depth exams for advanced physics classes are extremely hard to administrate.
Four Year Private College/University,Ph.D.,Urban Institution,1,51-100,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,3-4 days,NA,"I have found online teaching to be liberating. Students continue to interact with me during lectures, albeit now in multiple forms, such as online chat, texting, as well as verbal interaction. I find that (potentially) anonymous and non-verbal modes of interaction encourage more students to participate spontaneously without my having to solicit their input. These additional communication channels also give me more freedom to interact with students during lectures.

Online teaching also enabled me to continue to hold lectures even while I was sick with Covid-19. In the future, this will be my go-to approach to handling illness or travel, rather than asking a colleague to fill in or having to reschedule a lecture."
Four Year Private College/University,Ph.D.,Urban Institution,1,20-Nov,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,0-2 days,NA,"It was the undergraduate advanced lab, so the main challenge was in creating data analysis projects to replace our in-lab experiments.  Colleagues donated data sets, and it all worked out quite well for most of the class - in fact, 93% of the class advocated making a permanent change to incorporate data analysis projects in the syllabus.  However, about 25% of the lab groups had weaker programming skills, and needed a great deal of assistance."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,3,200 or more,"I have taught fully online previously.,I have taught in a blended online/in-person format previously.",1-2 weeks,NA,Hybrid class was easy to transition to online class.  Labs were possible because online labs had already been developed for another online class.
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,101-200,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,I used Skype to give the lectures. Students could give feedback either via the chat or by talking directly. Only one student was comfortable with asking questions using his voice. These lectures were  also recorded and remained available on Skype for 30 days. So students that were unable to attend the lecture in real time could use the recordings.
Four Year Private College/University,Bachelor's,Urban Institution,2,51-100,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,3-4 days,NA,"Maintaining a constant presence was very helpful for my students.  I tried to post on Teams a few times a day, often just sharing interesting new astronomy discoveries, a daily series of useless of facts, and reminders about assignments and tips on studying.  While we suspended our regular class evaluations, I had ~50% participation in an informal assessment survey on the course management page.  It was very useful.  Students indicated focusing on studying was harder, they had to work harder to stay on top of things, they preferred in-person, and that my changes to the course and my engagement was very helpful, especially when compared to other classes."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Urban Institution,1,51-100,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,3-4 days,NA,"One thing that greatly helped my transition was I was already using a technology-heavy classroom, with platforms for digitally enhanced teaching in-person (learning catalytics, Mastering Physics, teaching via mixed electronic media).  This helped in moving my in-person lectures online.  On the other hand, I struggled to get students to continue communicating with each other and forming ad-hoc study groups and support networks, and if teaching online again I would very much like to make this an active part of the class, both to prevent incoming biases of who already has support networks (e.g. family tutoring or greek life) that tend to bias studying away from students who are not already well-connected with resources coming in to the class."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,"Minority-Serving Institution,Urban Institution",2,10-Jun,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,5-6 days,NA,"Prior to Covid I was using Sakai to deliver prepared (LaTex for equations) notes and receive homeworks. I recorded each lecture and posted it to sakai after class with my slides narrated using iSpring Converter Pr. In Covid, the only change I made was to lecture on Zoom instead of in class. Student questions came in the Chat window at about the same rate as in class. I ran the final exam in real-time on Zoom."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Urban Institution,1,36-50,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"Regular class was taught in flipped-class format with weekly pre-class assignments and a mixture of online homework (WebAssign) and written homework for grading. Face-to-face in-class time is focused on multiple-choice questions answered via Plickers, and group problem-solving sessions with TAs and instructor circulating among students engaging them with socratic questioning. Solutions to problems and questions projected on a white screen are discussed on a chalk blackboard to the side. 
For online transition, pre-class assignments and homework maintained same structure, except written homeworks were scanned by the students and uploaded to cloud storage (OneDrive) using a Google form. Synchronous online classes used Zoom meeting sharing a split screen showing a virtual keyboard implemented with ExplainEverything running on iPad with Apple Pencil, side-by-side with a pdf with problems being given, mimicking face-to-face class setup. Multiple-choice answers were assessed in real time using ""Polls for Canvas""app, and problem-solving sessions were implemented using Zoom breakout rooms of 3-4 students, where TA and Instructors jump from room to room using the same socratic questioning strategy. 
2h in-class exams transitioned to 3h take-home exams to be scanned and submitted for grading, with an explicit request that students abide by code of conduct and do not search for answers on the internet or consult among them or with third-parties. An appeal for honesty and fairness to their fellow colleagues was also made during the class before the exam. Score distributions for these take-home exams largely followed similar trends to in-class exams and written homework performance, thus showing no evidence of cheating. Course evaluations were identical to the ones obtained for first part of the course which was taught face-to-face in its entirety (4.8/5.0 group median), though 73% of students responded this semester compared to 54% last semester. Main shortcoming of online class was the inability to maintain Breakout Room student assignment from class to class, due to my university/college/department not having an institutional license with Zoom and instead relying in less flexible technologies like WebEx. This hindered peer instruction, as students would have to ""break the ice"" anew for the first group problem in every online class."
Four Year Private College/University,Ph.D.,Urban Institution,1,101-200,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"The class I taught last semester than transitioned to online (about 2/3 of the way through) was a small upper-level undergrad class with 6 students, which made the transition and the ability to lecture online much easier. In addition, in lieu of written exams, conducted one-on-one oral exams with each of them (via zoom), which turned out to be a better way of gauging their understanding than written exams, and something I might consider in the future even when face-to-face classes can resume."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,51-100,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,5-6 days,NA,"I tried to teach very similarly to face-to-face. Students were already adjusted to that from the first part of the semester. I used Zoom breakout rooms for group work.

Survey advice: put all the questions on one page or have a progress indicator. I almost abandoned this as it had no clear ending for too long."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Urban Institution,1,20-Nov,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"One can do it, if necessary, but this is not real teaching/learning (at least for classes that involve critical thinking, not simply acquiring a well defined set of skills/""information units""/useful ""knowledge tools"". I may, of course, be wrong; if this is the case, I'm expendable - together with most of the physics faculty from most of the universities. Online teaching (for, e.g., graduate physics courses), if it is really meaningful and desirable, can be done most efficiently in a centralized manner by a relatively small number of highly qualified people. Otherwise, it should be avoided, even by taking some risks."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Rural Institution,3,21-35,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"I am a physics teaching assistant, so the courses I teach are part of a larger course taught by the main instructor.  The way recitations work in my course, however, is that they're twice weekly lectures, just in a smaller group.  When we transitioned to online classes, the main instructor for the course moved to using Khan Academy to provide the students with some instructional material.  While the Khan Academy materials do have useful information, they aren't really full lectures, so I ended up taking over the bulk of the lecturing responsibilities.  I would provide a lecture during our regular course time via Zoom and then edit and upload the video footage from the lecture so that students who could not tune in during our regular class time could still access the material.  Based on emails that my students sent to me as well as course evaluations, my students really valued this course structure and felt like it kept things as close to normal as they could have been.  Some of them were a bit frustrated with the Khan Academy videos and wanted their regular lectures by the main instructor as well.  So, from my limited experience and small sample size, I found that providing a synchronous Zoom lecture done as a normal, at the whiteboard lecture, with an asynchronous video uploaded afterward seemed to meet the needs of the students well, but using prerecorded videos from other institutions was a bit less helpful."
Four Year Private College/University,Ph.D.,Urban Institution,1,21-35,I have taught fully online previously.,5-6 days,NA,"While the transition was abrupt and we (the instructors) had to scramble to figure out how to make things work, especially in terms of group work (tutorials, labs), it really helped that the students and instructors all already knew each other. This allowed us to maintain a strong sense of community and a high level of interaction after the transition.  This would have been much harder to achieve with a group of students who had never met each other. 
Indeed, in a previous experience teaching an asynchronous MOOC, we tried to add synchronous office-hours type sessions each week, but very few students participated. We also tried to create community through the discussion board, but did not have a lot of success in getting students to interact with each other."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,"Minority-Serving Institution,Hispanic-Serving Institution,Urban Institution",1,36-50,I have taught in a blended online/in-person format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,It was easy once I figured out how to make breakout rooms in Teams so that student could go into small groups.
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,3,101-200,I have taught fully online previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"I like teaching synchronously and have already been using lecture capture (for students who miss class), LearningCatalytics, MasteringPhysics, and an e-text. The latter 3 were essential for online teaching, so they did not have to change. I found most students did not participate synchronously, so LearningCatalytics for real-time TPS questions was not very useful (and thus was no longer graded for participation). Delivering exams was problematic. We had access to Respondus' Lockdown Browser and Monitor, so I tried to use both. Most students could use them adequately, though neither turned out very useful in attempting to detect cheating. I could only assume that students were less willing to attempt cheating, and they will adapt and attempt to cheat in the future (they are easily side-stepped by using another device). I was able to deliver multiple-choice self-graded exams through Blackboard."
Two Year Public College,Associate degree,Minority-Serving Institution,3,21-35,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"We have used FlipitPhysics for many years as our textbook and online homework system, so we were lucky - it already has lectures built in that we had been requiring of our students anyway. I initially relied on this, Zoom office hours (daily), and detailed notes that I posted. I have since added a voice-over to the notes. I spend a lot of time (much more than pre-Covid) answering emails from and about students. I have also seen my service work and time in meetings skyrocket."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Urban Institution,1,101-200,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,5-6 days,NA,"I'm teaching a special program for a select group of incoming undergraduates (first years and transfer students). It's very low-level, but focused on content that's research-aligned, rather than intro physics.  I had hoped that there would be some good interactive web content or videos available, but I was dismayed at the options (nothing interactive, also nearly everything featured a white male expert), so I decided it was worth my time to create more of the content than I'd originally intended."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Urban Institution,3,200 or more,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"I had to record my lectures before the actual classes met, that was like 3 times per week. Also I had to prepare multiple choice questions. Other than that it was a nice transition. I  love online teaching since it gives me more time to spend with my family as well as teach what I love to others."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Rural Institution,3,36-50,I have taught in a blended online/in-person format previously.,5-6 days,NA,"I ranked the usefulness of tools such as zoom classmeetings and online grading from the perspective of whether I could teach the class without them.  I want to be clear, however, that I had not choice to use these tools and more importantly, *NONE* of them supplant face to face instruction and hands on laboratory experiences."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,"Minority-Serving Institution,Urban Institution",2,51-100,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,0-2 days,NA,My students turn off their cameras during zoom sessions. I find it very hard to gauge their engagement without visual queues. Student performance on Homework is a bit below historical averages but test performance is statistically indistinguishable from previous years.
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Hispanic-Serving Institution,1,20-Nov,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"Everyone had video off and muted during class.

It is very important to me to see the students' faces during class, how they react, behave, etc. Without such instant feedback, it feels impossible to judge how much they are able to follow the lectures and I cannot adjust the pace and level accordingly. It feels like I'm talking at the wall, which is demotivating for me too, something that affects my teaching badly. I find it important to see how they are doing on a regular basis, which again is difficult without meeting them. I need to zoom with them a lot individually because although I have regular weekly discussions, they sometimes cannot make it due to their up-side-down schedules (no structure provided by the regularities of classes and discussions). Thus, to accommodate all their needs I have to make (a lot) more time for them as before. Online teaching feels like cheating them, not providing them with the university experience that very much relies on communication and interaction."

Transitioning online was easy, simply point a web cam at a legal pad and start teaching on Zoom, same as regular class (except they don't see me and I can not do live demos). Students appreciated that they did not have to learn anything new tech for the transition in my classes. The BIGGEST problem with online teaching is the cheating on the exams and ways to police it to ensure no cheating. Overall, despite the ~1/3 of the class taught online, it was a success. Some comments below indicate that even though it is a traditional course, students like the delivery method (before and after COVID19). Here are two comments from students on the end of the semester teaching evaluations: ""What a great course! I had come into this course with a prior love for physics from high school and horror stories of college physics. I understand the horror, but the fun and newfound knowledge definitely outweighs the nastier parts including equations. This course rekindled my love for learning. I had never been so proud to show my parents how I could calculate the torque, final velocity, and possibly the angular momentum of something under super specific conditions. MMP and Written HW were components that I used to check my learning after a week of classes--that system was very efficient and productive for me. The individual and group quizzes were also really helpful. I was wary of the group ones, but I found myself studying harder so I wouldn't let them down in case one of them couldn't study. Exams were hard, but they weren't completely foreign. All in all, this was a really fantastic course that definitely requires TIME for studying, but each one of those hours is so very much worth the time put into it."" and comment 2, ""What an awesome instructor. I found myself comparing my other professors to him. The material was difficult, and memorizing some equations/constants/mathematical relations could easily be grueling, but he made it anything but. The live demos were amazing, and showed me how much I don't know. He's a wealth of knowledge, and is uber flexible in the way he teaches--anybody could learn even if they knew absolutely nothing about science."""

I managed to give a 3rd exam, but worried tremendously how stressed and anxious students might be feeling. I become severely discouraged by my failings as an instructor and caring for my students. I ended up offering everyone an A for the work they had completed up to that point.

I eventually figured out how to set up break-out rooms for the in-class activities that we used to do at our 9 person tables, but it was very awkward to visit them in Microsoft Teams. In talking with my student advisees (I have about 20), the quasi-synchronous way that most faculty in our department adopted was more popular (at least for this very odd semester) than the more fully online approaches that other departments tried. The diversity of different approaches that they got across departments was confusing to them.

Most of my prep time was not spent on the class I responded about in the survey (highest-enrollment one, a lecture), but rather on figuring out how to run our lab class remotely.

I feel like we had so many people trying to help that it was counterproductive.

We slowed our tempo a little, and were more generous with small issues like late homework, but there were not many. 

HW: Homework was scanned and submitted online pre and post transition. No change. We slightly reduced the difficulty and length after transition due to loss of good study sessions (below)
EXAMS: 1st midterm was evening, in-class.  2nd midterm and final (post transition) were done same time scale, online (using the same scan method as homework.) Students ""Zoomed"" in so we could communicate during the exam (and see them). Went smoothly, no indication of cheating, no complaints, few issues. 
We use ""2-stage"" (group) exams pre transition, but decided to lose that after transition. 

LECTURES: Lectured MWF@9 AM. Lecture capture system is in the room for after-class viewing available all term.  Continued to lecture via Zoom,  (continued after transition, I was able to go in and use that same room, so Asynchronous videos were same as before) Live attendance dropped significantly, by on average a factor of 2 after the transition. Students' viewing of lecture capture videos increased somewhat from about 20% of my students  regularly viewing to about 35%... 

CLICKER QUESTIONS: Stopped after transition. Asked the questions during live Zoom, but little student interaction (just responses on Zoom chat) 

IN-CLASS SMALL GROUP ACTIVITIES: Typically had one (or two) 15-20 minute activities/week before transition. Completely stopped after transition.

STUDY-SESSIONS: We had 3 hrs/week of staffed study sessions in the building. Pre transition about 30% of the class came. Post transition we continued via zoom, but only a handful (5%) showed up regularly.

Student evaluations were extremely strong, they liked how we did it. But, only half the students evaluated! 
I lost about 5% of my class (dropped) after the transition, more than usual. 
No more students than usual failed (just a couple). Students could opt for P/F after the final, I don't know how many chose this, it goes through the registrar's office. But our grade distribution was similar to past terms, with a small number (5%) of D's and F's."

I would also like to add that many of your questions are very poorly described.   For example ""what is the largest class you have taught"" like this semester?  or ever?  and I tried to comment near the 'rate how good this thing was' question as I don't know what I am supposed to compare it to.

Have already lots of handouts and tutorials for this class, which I now posted instead of distributing on paper. I already posted lots of resources  in canvas during the face-to-face time, so students were used to going online regularly. Homework (MasteringPhysics) was already online as were the readiness assessment tests.

Besides the course, I teach the associated lab and a Supplemental Instruction course for the same students, so I have a lot of contact and I knew the students from last semester. The established learning community feeling helped keeping students engaged. I used all my courses as entry points: SI and labs used breakout rooms so there was still small group interaction. I already used online readiness assessments which allow students to ask questions and me to connect one-on-one with them. I put in a lot of my time (from the announcement to go online up to the end of the semester), but the transition was fairly smooth for the students. I am proud I did not lose anyone in this course.

Challenge was to design exams that can be administered online; I do not believe in online proctoring (there are still many ways to cheat and it intrudes privacy). My normal exam style questions include many free response questions with sub-questions, which I felt do not work online. I am not satisfied with multiple choice exams, so I needed to be creative.

Most of my students need more face-to-face time, not less.  If we are to establish a ""community-of-learners"" online is NOT the way to do it.  And, a number of students have figured out how to ""game the system"" (cheat)  to inflate their grades.  This is unfair to serious students.  And, I am uncomfortable ""passing"" students who are clearly under performing and under prepared to advance.  This puts an enormous burden on faculty teaching follow-on courses and degrades the college degree.  It certainly does not convey to the student their deficiencies, as well as, and undermining the purpose of college and the college experience.  It feeds into the perception that college is a ""credentialing"" process not an educational process."

Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,36-50,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,NA,"By far the most important aspect in the transition was to make myself available for the students on Zoom as often as possible. Recording the lectures helps. New platforms help (though I would argue that complexity should be minimized). However, letting the students know, repeatedly, that you will find time to meet with them, was crucial. I did so sometimes during the weekends, sometimes late after dinner, and I would occasionally find them in small Zoom groups trying to understand the material or wrestling with a mathematical proof that I assigned in class. Those extra interactions where each person was connecting from their own room, made a big difference, and were greatly appreciated."

My goal was to replicate the interactions and assessments that happened face to face as well as possible. That helped me get off the ground quickly in planning and communicating my plans to students. I also had the benefit of one class period in person before we went online when I knew the switch was happening, which let me do a test run of Zoom with my students physically in the room, and I think that was very helpful for them."

I decided to make short lecture and example problem videos that my students could watch asynchronously. For synchronous discussion we used Zoom. On a typical day I would post some discussion questions to be answered via the polling feature, which would often lead to a good discussion, then I would put students into ""Breakout Rooms"" and they would either work on a problem or on a computational project. It worked quite well. Homework was from the book, assigned every class day and due the next class day - but I was much more flexible with late work than I usually am."
Four Year Private College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,36-50,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,5-6 days,NA,"The course I took online was a second year math and computational methods course for physics majors. It combines traditional mathematics instruction (lectures, discussion sections, written weekly homework) with complementary scientific programming in Python (two intro interactive lectures, weekly Jupyter homework). The programmatic part was already provided through a course JupyterHub server and we already used Piazza for class discussion and a simple HTML website which I maintained for assignments, lecture notes, etc. The only things we did to go online were: 
1. Switch to Zoom lectures (recorded for those in different time zones) in which I asked students to either interrupt or use the group chat to ask questions/discuss and did 1-2 simple zoom polls per lecture.
2. Have homework submitted as scanned PDFs (we encouraged students to use camscanner or equivalent) to a Dropbox file request link. We marked up these PDFs with iPads to grade them and emailed them back out.
This worked fine.

The biggest problems:
1. Going to essentially untimed take home exams (24 or 48 hours) to accommodate multiple time zones meant that I had to write them to be hard to use the internet for cheating. This made them hard exams but mostly seems to have worked. Of course, we can't guarantee that students didn't get help but that's essentially impossible.
2. Peer-to-peer learning (eg. through working on homework together in the undergrad physics lounge, etc) is essentially lost."

However there was much  less peer discussion during Zoom classes.  To facilitate discussion, I would walk away from the meeting for about a minute and I could hear a louder buzz among students. We tried breaking into smaller groups and reconvening but that was clunky so gave up on that.  I like the fact that I could record my class and post it together with the document camera class notes.

Week 0, Developed policy, syllabus changes, and professor contact information. Adjusted calendar of class meetings and learning objectives for those class meetings (adding online responsibilities for students), sent a ""Changes to Course Number XXXX"" notice email to all students. Delivery technology beta testing (camera, laptop choice MAC or PC, bandwidth available at my home provided by Xfinity (Speakeasy speed test), and preparation of lecture materials for audio and video recording. Finally, I prepared 5 class sessions (scanned handouts-PDF, made notes to self to be more demonstrative in my voice delivery so to keep the attention of the students and typical review of lecture material prior to class).  These five classes were ""audio only"" lectures and to be delivered asynchronously. The purpose of the audio lectures was to meet institutional goals (ready to start online/remote delivery by Week 1) and to allow me prepare to add the video component for Week 2.  Week 1, students gained access through D2L and navigated to the News portal. Here they received a Power Point slide package for the day's lesson and my audio lecture. While students were signing on each class period and sending me questions (if any),  Also during Week 1, I was practicing and recording the lessons for analysis and mastering (what I could) a live delivery system, sharing PowerPoints, simulations, and videos for Week 2 delivery. AT this time, I made changes to my office at home and made a ""educational video studio"". The area needed to be a quiet place away from pets and people, neutral background, and comfortable because this is my classroom for the two months averaging 3 three classes a day. (Don't forget to have your coffee/water/etc. available.) After a few tries, I was feeling confident using Zoom and sharing other video components and ready to go live during Week 2. Week 2 had its challenges (not all students could do synchronous, students did not have handouts/observation lab sheets available, students needed ""handholding"", others were not engaged. During this time,  I performed many hours outside of class dealing with student's inability to manage the technology (connection speed, can't locate the lesson/lab, or simply not attending class). I went on a recruiting campaign to ask those, who were not attending, to return to class. Prior to my request, I only had 50% attending, after the request, 80%. By the end of the semester, 88% were attending, remaining students dropped the course. Week 3, the course dynamics smoothed and the delivery felt more face to face. The students were familiar with the  delivery system and were learning. I did notice a drop in median test scores from face-to-face delivery to online lecture/testing of +/- 10%,  (median= 82% to 75%) across all sections. I conclude this to be a case ""online student fatigue"" with those students taking more than one online course as opposed to students taking just one. I continued the Week 2 approach through the final week of the course meetings. I recently completed the semester and happy to decompress. I am sure I will reflect on this time and discover other revelations as my recollections become clearer."

In class meetings students work in groups and, when in person, undergraduate assistants and I move from group to group to discuss the material.  We had to emulate the latter using Zoom breakout sessions.  The limitations of the system meant that I functioned as a traffic cop, steering assistants to individual group breakout rooms.  I was no longer able to devote any time to answering questions myself.  We ran a new separate section for students in an Asian time zone.  Fortunately, one of our assistants was also in such a time zone.  Providing a secure exam was a challenge.  I wound up using Qualtrics, with multiple choice questions delivered to students in random order and not allowing students to go back to a previous question. Extra problems were added to make up for the student not being able to go back, (which was bad on its own and also meant students had to worry more about time management). Students taking the exam were simultaneously logged onto a Zoom session with their mics on (but not video- too intrusive)."

They thought I was joking, but then our state's stay at home order came just a few days afterward. My preference was asynchronous Khan Academy-style lectures so that students with less internet bandwidth could still participate without missing anything, but I had enough people who wanted synchronous lectures that I found a middle ground. I record a 15-minute mini-lecture and post it for students to watch asynchronously, then we meet synchronously for about half the time we did before, where we still do the peer instruction with iclicker cloud software. Learning Zoom was a little stressful, but once I got it figured out I don't mind it so much. Feedback from students has been very positive.

Also, about 35-50% of students simply stopped turning in assignments or taking tests.  It seems that without someone to hold their hands in-person through the process of learning, the majority of students at my school flounder.  This was true both in the introductory physics courses as well as the upper level undergrad physics courses.  Maybe it's different at R1 schools, but we were an R3 school reclassified as an R2 in 2018, so our student body may be different.  As an aside, I was very worried that my transition of my upper level E&M class to online learning this spring was horribly ineffective.

Planning, scripting, recording, re-recording when I messed things up, organizing, and posting with embedded questions of the videos resulted in something like doubling or tripling of the prep time for lectures.

The technology tools provided through the university (Zoom) has facilitated an easy transition to remote synchronous learning. The key features include the breakout rooms and built in screen sharing and whiteboard functions (with an appropriate drawing device). In my case, I open the zoom meeting on my laptop, which is where I control such things as participants and breakout rooms. I also join the meeting on an iPad, which combined with a high quality stylus, makes whiteboard work a breeze.

My experience has been that the transition from face-to-face to remote synchronous instruction has been pretty seamless. Furthermore, up to this point in our current semester, student engagement and performance is comparable to face-to-face classes.

The biggest concerns we have in our department are (1) how to incorporate laboratory type activities, and (2) the loss of the peer support structure among upper division majors (our department has a dedicated majors room where a lot of collaboration on coursework and positive socializing takes place)."

My at-home technical equipment was minimal and out of date (I did almost all my work from the office) but I was one of the fortunate few faculty authorized to come into the office for my Zoom sessions.  Talking to other users was by far the most effective form of help.  I finally settled on a simple but unsatisfactory method of writing out lecture notes and screen-sharing them as I lectured during my synchronous classes, and posting them afterwards.  Breaks for TopHat quizzes or to ask for questions produced almost no interaction, though almost all my class of 29 did join each session.  I converted my exams to take-home (never having done that in 40 years of teaching; that was an unfortunate learning experience as well).  The whole experience was profoundly disheartening, ineffective, and resented by my students.  My own incompetence contributed; I had virtually no prior experience with consumer electronics or social media at any level, and the students found that to be contemptible.   Whatever success I have had in my teaching career was entirely based on circumstances no longer in effect on line.  I took the opportunity to retire this July 1, partly to avoid teaching online in the fall.  (Though I might have retired then anyway, any wavering was eliminated by the prospect of an entire semester like the last few weeks)."

I believe the most important unit for physics and engineering majors in this course is the relationship between electric potential and field, and we completed that before spring break during in-person instruction.  We then did magnetic fields and electromagnetic radiation online.  Our instruction in those topics has always been descriptive and not mathematically rigorous, so I could put together some asynchronous interactive activities based on PhET, Mastering Physics assignments, and Khan Academy videos and feel good about it.

After the first lecture, one student told me that he felt as if  he was  “sitting next  to you and watching you write on your pad”. There were more questions in this format than in the face-to-face instruction. I was also able to di some demos in realtime and at least they were able too see the results on a screen, again with the help of a camera. The closest ""online teaching” (felt like that)  I had done was lecturing to 360 students in UPII in a huge auditorium. I think overall it went well.

I was already using Canvas and Poll Everywhere, so online course management was not new to me (but no less time consuming).
2. Miraculously, when I had taught this course previously, I recorded the lectures using a classroom lecture capture system.  I was able to use these videos rather than making new ones, although I still had live Zoom meetings in which I did new examples.  I uploaded the videos to Panopto and integrated the Poll Everywhere questions so that the video paused for students to vote just like they were in the classroom.
3.  The labs were the most difficult adjustment.  We had zero videos ahead of time, so I frantically tried to make recordings of our apparati before classes resumed.  Learning Adobe Premiere Pro was a lot of work, and dealing with large files was difficult to do from home.

Even with Lockdown Browser and Respondus proctoring system, some grades were a higher then expected... but that's what it is."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,51-100,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,3-4 days,Tenured faculty with research expectations,"The format of my class was studio physics, which means that A.)  the students spend most of their time lecture days working problems in groups, and B.) those same groups would do the labs that were integrated with the course material.  The shutdown came during spring break, which meant I had about three days to figure out the remainder of the five weeks left in the semester.  The work in groups I used the Zoom breakout rooms to put students together for group work on shared whiteboards.  I wrote online simulation based labs to make up for the ones that we would have done in person, and allowed students the option of submitting their lab reports themselves, but also meeting at the normal class time (I estimated about 1/4 of students attended the videoconference for the labs).  Tests were submitted online, and I chose not to use strict proctoring like Honorlock.  Grade results for the remaining exams were not very different from previous in class semesters, so if there was cheating, it was fairly ineffective.  Exams were submitted and then marked up using Canvas' annotate feedback tool.
Overall, except for the students who for some reasons simply never attended class again and did not drop/withdraw, the whole experience worked ""enough"".  Not something I would choose to do, and somehow more work, but even those students I was most worried about (including those with accommodations) seemed to finish out okay."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,200 or more,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,5-6 days,Tenure-track with research expectations,"We are on the quarter system, so the biggest challenge was to be thrown into this suddenly from the design perspective up. In addition, I was sick with COVID19 in the interquarter break, so it took me a couple of weeks to even get to a level bearing. I feel I have lost a lot of contact with students, it's harder to support students who are struggling, I have to continually experiment as I find the tools do not do what I expect them to, the level of cheating is very high, and there is simply not enough time to deal with all the issues that are happening. On the other hand, students are making use of the resources, there are new opportunities to provide support during exams, and for some students this has turned out to be a better format for self-paced learning."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,2,21-35,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,Other,"As a graduate student, I wasn't particularly involved in the transition to online teaching midway through the spring semester, so I don't know too much of what the faculty were up to.  I did end up scanning a lot of documents to PDF for one of the classes where I was a teaching assistant, and set up a Discord channel for the students of the class.  I'm not sure the professor did much for that one, beyond providing the scanned notes.  

he other class I was TA for during the spring transitioned to online using blackboard and pre-recorded lectures.  The homework changed to blackboard assignments/quizzes, and the labs were moved online by way of providing the students with video and photographs of the experimental apparatus in use, so they could make their own measurements.  From what I heard it didn't always go well, and some students struggled working on their own.  

This summer, I am teaching one of the introductory physics lecture courses.  The class is completely online.  I'm using Zoom to do lectures at the normal time the class would meet if it were still done in a classroom on campus, and use the screen sharing features to use an art program as a virtual whiteboard (I have a tablet, so writing is quite easy this way).  I record my lectures and post them online in case a student misses a lecture, although I do still expect them to attend them live whenever possible.  

For the homework, since the overall summer class enrollment is relatively small, the students are working assigned problems by hand and uploading the scanned work to Blackboard to turn it in.  The tools available to me for grading work handed in in this manner are less than ideal, but I do prefer the approach of handling things as much like an in person class as possible.  I administered the first exam (the class is still ongoing) as a test in Blackboard, with most questions as essay questions so the students could show their work by typing it in.  This did not go over as well, so I will probably explore ways for the students to just provide their own handwritten work going forward.  

I think the labs for the summer courses are following the style from the end of last semester.  The lab coordinator takes pictures and video of all relevant measurements and the students are expected to use them to sort of do the lab on their own.  Labs have three Zoom sessions a week where the lab instructors can speak with the students and help them with any questions.  We have encountered some issues with the photos and other information for lab (provided in a folder on google drive) not being organized well, and are working on improving it.  An unusual issue we encountered for lab is that the lab coordinator used a color coding system for the masses added to a hanger in one experiment, so students would need to ""read"" the total mass based on colored tape on each mass.  One student is colorblind, so that method had to be abandoned."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Urban Institution,1,20-Nov,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,5-6 days,Tenured faculty with research expectations,"Since this semester I had decided to prepare my in person classes in Power Point, delivering them on a Tablet with a stylus which allowed for handwriting during a Power Point delivery, the transition to on-line was pretty straightforward regarding the content. However, not being able to see the students' faces during the lectures was a big minus and, while the students still were able to ask questions, I've noticed that their participation on line was less than in face to face classes.
A positive side was that absolutely every student joined the on-line synchronous class, while some students would miss face-to-face classes; but my impression is that it happened because it was a way to find a ""real life"" community during the COVID-19 crisis, i.e., my impression is that this may not be the case for on-line classes in regular times."

Four Year Private College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,101-200,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,Tenured faculty with research expectations,"I was surprised that at least initially, most of my teaching effort had to go into working with and to the extent possible, assuaging, student anxiety about the overall global situation and our specific course situation.  We spent a week or more after the transition to online talking about expectations and course format in gory detail.  I don't know that I was expecting that, or at least expecting it to that extent, and given that the situation in the fall will be similar (uncertain students being taught by non-expert online teachers) I'd like to be able to plan for it better.

I also found it even more difficult when lecturing via recording or Zoom to gauge what students were understanding and what they weren't and left very uncertain how to assay this in an online format.  I usually use informal hand-raise style queries in person and didn't find a great substitute for this kind of on the fly communication in an online lecture.

I had to laugh at your list of technologies I could have used. There was no time even to research what the options were! I desperately needed a personal consultant who could make technology recommendations and answer my questions about what various technologies would and wouldn't do--and my university provided no such consultant. Moreover, I didn't want to impose stringent technical requirements on my students on such short notice. So I just kept things as low-tech as possible, telling students to read their textbook and then type questions in online discussions. I learned that many of them find reading distasteful. They really prefer watching videos!"

These include my LMS (Blackboard) - including Blackboard Collaborate for ""Online Office Hours"", which I've held in the last evening as an option for students for many, many years). I already use an online homework system in the class (MyOpenMath). I repurposed this system to build the online class into two asynchronous learning modules per week, complete with built-in exercises/assessment. Further, I've personally taken about half a dozen online courses in the past year (all related to instructional design and multimedia design), so I was very well equipped to move my own course online (I am so glad that I took these courses - turned out to be brilliant timing, in hindsight)! Most faculty, however, went into this situation with a lot less training and experience then me...

I went fully asynchronous due to timezone and time management issues (including being stuck at home with a kindergartener) and my biggest takeaway was that while that was the most flexible and convenient, I did miss regular synchronous interaction with the students. For the Fall, I plan to continue with significant asynchronous content but also incorporate more synchronous aspects to help maintain a class learning community. My university intends to have some face-to-face class time but my class is based on groupwork/active learning that won't work in a socially-distanced classroom..."

I don't want to use AV conferencing technology.
I don't want to use any such tech media as a primary means of communication. It is inefficient, frustrating, reduces learning, strains communication, and doubles everyone's workloads.
My anxiety through all of this is greatly magnified as I have ASD and GAD.
I've also had a similar experience with transition to online labs... many students wrote in their evals that they need to see and get their hands on the equipment to understand it.
Online learning works well for too few people to replace live instruction.
Go back to meeting in person and make online a ""last resort only"" strategy.

FYI, the one online ""class"" that I have previously taught was online astronomy lab. It's just preformatted questionnaires and students can email me with questions.

With regard to the 30-minute interview question in this survey, as I explained, I am uncomfortable with being on camera. Perhaps phone or email would work better, but, given my hesitation (rather than willingness) to be contacted for such an interview, I will have to decline entering my email in that field."

My students did not have kids so we could meet at our regular class time, but I also recorded lessons in case someone had to miss. I tried to get the same amount of interaction as we had before the transition to online, with virtual office hours, virtual student meet-ups/study-groups, and lots of opportunities to answer questions and ask questions during lessons.
My colleagues and I met for coffee most days to talk about what was working and what was not. I know some faculty members struggled, but I honestly think that where there is a will, there is a way to teach in a fun and engaging way.
I should note that I extensively used Canvas/Blackboard for my face-to-face classes before the transition to remote learning, so that really prepared me as all my materials were neatly organized already online and I had given out electronic assignments before. For some of my colleagues, this was all new."

Zoom breakout sessions work reasonably well with the ISLE approach I've used predominantly and most activities only needed to be modified slightly, often in the form of videotaping demos and labs. There were of course issues, particularly around time management and adapting labs for a video format. Some worked well enough, others not so much. Also, some students experienced tech problems, as did I from time to time. All that said some students tended to become more involved with the online format. The pros did not outweigh the cons in my mind and I don't particularly look forward to doing this again in the fall, except to say it is looking like the safe thing to do. I don't want to put myself and others at risk for the sake of having them drop a coffee filter rather than make measurements off a video. Mostly what I need to prepare is simply more time, although I also will try to improve on managing the sessions productively and try out ideas around making the labs asynch."

Only about 1/3 students attend the synchronous lecture where we use chat for questions (very few)...so I assume the rest of the class listens to the saved cloud recordings.  Difficult and time consuming to save more than 1MB  or ~ 6 lectures.  I spend ~15 hours more per week teaching this way.

(2)  Your questions focus very much on modern technology.  Besides slides in PPT, nearly all my lectures were on paper with an old webcam showing everything I derived or example I went through.  Better than any fancy gaget (if I can fix some problems with the autofocus).

We did not have great discussions on Zoom as it was too easy for students to not turn on their video and remain silent. We felt blind as the visual clues we had so relied on were not available via Zoom. Teaching a guided-inquiry style course on-line was do-able but we would need to work hard on getting the same level of interaction that we did in person. Online assessment without cheating was hard.

We used MS Teams, on the recommendation of my institution, to meet synchronously every lecture. I used the files function to upload updated syllabus, general and project information. I used the chat window to get students to answer on the fly questions, making sure they could write an answer down and then all submit simultaneously to reveal answers - a little like clicker questions. Overall, the learning gain through the semester was a little higher than previous face-to-face delivery of the same course.

My greatest concern in all of this, however, is grade inflation and lack of ability to do in person lab exercises.

That quickly fell apart as I do a lot of in-class collaborative work with the students working in groups of 2 to 3. The other issue is that my students had to struggle with both tech access (both computers and wifi) and time shifts with both work and home pressures. Within a week about a third of my students went asynchronous and just watched the Zoom recordings. 
I used Canvas extensively to add videos of lecture demos and to provide links to physics applets. In future I would plan to make exams/quizzes that directly tie into these applets. 
The biggest transition for me was going to all lecture format with only some student feedback via Chat. I tried various polling programs but the tech issues with the students all having different systems was too much of a disruption rather than a help, plus, a third of my students were not live anyway, so polling (sort of ""clicker style"" questions) seemed somewhat pointless. 
The biggest misery was exams. I'm certain that cheating was prevalent. On the simplest level, the exam averages went from low 70s to upper 80s. I also had to spend extensive time rewriting my exams so that they could not be simply Googled to find complete solutions."

Our results were much more representative of in-class results from years previous, though cheating is still possible.
Even with our diligence in preparing exams, our department head was teaching a lower-level, 1-hour course required for physics majors.  In this small course, 75% of the students in the course joined a GroupMe where they shared the same ""wrong"" answers.   (They didn't realize that the answers were randomized!)

Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,51-100,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,Tenure-track with research expectations,"People seem to be divided strongly into two camps for synchronous vs. asynchronous interaction with students.  My opinion is strongly on the asynchronous side, at least for lecture materials; I think the traditional lecture format translates very poorly to online/remote learning.

For asynchronous teaching, I strongly believe that dividing the material into smaller portions is useful; my lecture materials were recorded in 10-15 minute videos.  At the same time, I believe it is important to have *some* synchronous component, e.g. real-time chat, Zoom office hours, live examples in order to interact with students and give them the opportunity for immediate feedback.  The ability to have direct interaction with students is what can separate standard university remote classes from the MOOC model."

This all took about 8 hours of work per hour of content -- way more time that I was spending on the in-class version of the course, which I had taught multiple times. (I'm chair of my department, and I chose to teach a class that I could teach without a lot of new prep -- boy was I wrong!) Although my institution switched to a Pass/Fail system in which students have an option to ""uncover"" their grades, I changed the default grading rubric to provide the students with many more options (weight pre-covid work higher, submit a project in place of the final exam, or take an exam in place of a project, etc.) I switched written homework and in-class exams to online versions administered through Gradescope. At the beginning, I polled students to ask about their access to technology, their biggest concerns, etc. (Their two biggest concerns were: staying motivated, and integrity of exams. Personal health and safety was far down the list.) I made clear that we would proceed with flexibility, compassion, and generosity. I think it was a success, but I hope it's an experience none of us has to repeat."

Four Year Public College/University,Bachelor's,Rural Institution,2,36-50,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,Tenure-track with research expectations,"I found that a synchronous lecture using Powerpoint over WebEx allowed me to do almost everything I would have been able to do in my planned class except for student homework presentations, group work, and in-class exams. I had to modify my syllabus to remove the requirement that student teams present a homework problem in class every other week, making the homework grade entirely based on written solutions.  

Lectures: I used an iPad to share my screen and annotate my slides to include the content I would have put on the board like example problems and derivations. The prepared slides were a mix of blank slides with titles and slides with content.  The saved slides that I posted for my students included annotations and I also posted the WebEx recordings of the lectures to Canvas for students who lacked reliable internet or were unable to attend synchronously due to time zone differences.  The main aspect of lecture I missed was face-to-face interaction where I could use facial expression and body language cues to gauge student understanding. Also, the students seemed hesitant to ask questions in class when they were being recorded so I offered them the opportunity to ask questions via online survey in advance of the lecture to earn their participation credit.

Office Hours: I was also able to project my iPad screen on WebEx during online office hours to ""write on the board"" for students. Students sent me messages/photos via Telegram chat to ask questions about their work, allowing me to see how their solutions were progressing. 

Course management and grading: I had already used gradescope extensively for paperless submission of homework and grading so that transition was straightforward. I also already used Canvas for online reading quizzes and course management. 

Exams: The main challenge was ensuring the integrity of exams.  I allowed the students to pick the format of the midterm exams and they chose a 3 day take home exam which was open note and open book. The final was the same format, but with a self-imposed 3 hour time limit.  I am still not sure if they followed the time limit or the requirement not to consult the internet or each other, though I saw no direct evidence of cheating.

Student feedback: I offered several opportunities for anonymous feedback during the transition to online. In general, the students reported a positive experience though some reported internet access issues prevented them from fully engaging in the synchronous lectures.  The students who completed the end of semester evaluation gave the course an overall 4.75/5 rating, though they did acknowledge they understood the challenges I faced in converting to online and were likely more lenient than if the course had been planned to be online from the beginning. They also recognized that I was bandwidth-limited since I had an infant and school age kids unexpectedly at home."

Attendance rates at the synchronous Zoom-based lab class we tried (with breakout rooms for lab groups) were horrible. Attendance rates at our asynchronous, drop-in Zoom+Slack help sessions were horrible. Assignment completion rates were bad, and students who did turn work in seemed to be merely going through the steps mechanically, as if looking for easy points and not actually engaging. It's like everyone was in shock.

Word of mouth in the department and on campus is that this was a widespread phenomenon, not limited to this intro lab course."

The aim being to keep a similar dynamics to the face-to-face teaching. This was somewhat successful. 

But it is clear to me that this is not the correct strategy. Students learning remotely can't really interact in the same way as we did in our studio classes. Though young students are used to online interactions, they also keep some distance (privacy). 

So, a future online teaching course (on the Fall), will require some restructuring of the teaching that uses more systematically online tools of interaction. We have employed for example a LON-CAPA platform that gives good real-time feedback on the exercises. That's a good example of how things should work, I think."

It was not possible to gauge the level of understanding of the audience, since I could not observe them as a group. For graduate classes, video-conferencing is not effective, as most of the lectures are dynamic interactions between the students and me, which was not possible at all without creating an audio chaos."

The issue that arise from this the students access to  internet connectivity.  My courses already used the publishers website for homework and a third party polling app, both of which work fine when students have access to campus wifi.  Once they were dispersed there was no guarantee they could safely access reliable internet at the required times. I had to abandon the polling app, because I couldn't penalize students without internet.  Average attendance went from 70-80% to about 10-20% for the the synchronous lectures. Only one student contacted me via zoom for ""office-hours"" and the general interaction with student approached zero.  This approach entirely defeats the point of paying for a university education if the students end up just watching videos and answering a few questions from a text. I now understand the frustration my colleagues have with teaching online courses and teaching upper level courses to students that took the prerequisites online.     

Like many of us, I noticed the scores on the online midterm were much better than the in-class midterm.   However the scores on a final conceptual assessment were worse than expected, when compared with there online midterm grades.  Suggesting this mode of learning wasn't actually improving their understanding. Many colleagues at my university and other had issues with cheating through the Chegg platform, which made us question the validity of any of the online grades.

I learned that at risk students are put more at risk by remote learning. Students with some kinds of ADHD really struggle without the structure of coming to class.

It is much more difficult to get the students to interact with each other during the synchronous meeting times. I think this is partially due to technology (some don't have dependable internet, and few have the ability to write with a digital pen), but it is also cultural (they typically use the internet for passive consumption of information). I am also having an issue preventing cheating on homework and exams, whereas that's easier to prevent in a face-to-face setting. I like to do lots of demo experiments and make time to play with them and even allow students to interact with them. I've come up with some home demos, but not nearly as much. That said, this has forced me to make videos of the lecture-part of the class, rather than using some in-class time to do this. I can make this available asynchronously and use normal meeting times to work together on homework problems and tutorials. The biggest issue is students don't know how to get students to better engage and discuss with each other online - it's difficult to monitor progress in zoom rooms and organically switch back and forth between small and large group discussions."

Of course, one group did not hear what other groups were saying to each other, or hear their conversations with me.  That was a downside.

Four Year Private College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,20-Nov,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,5-6 days,Full time instructional faculty without tenure,"I think online classes are enormously effective for large enrollments in which the student-to-instructor contact is barely existent in the face-to-face setting. Better to record lectures once for all, with the students accessing at any time, and then go for recitations in small classes, and to offer more office hours. 

The case of graduate instruction is different, and it would be preferable in this case to have face-to-face interactions is quite beneficial.

In any event we have to rethink this inefficient routine of going to class with notes and repeating every year the same stuff. Consider also that we could address a much large audience with online courses, which is extremely important since about one person each 10,000 in the world has a scientific education.

Another advantage of online classes is that people with disabilities, either instructors or students, can participate in the teaching and learning process in a much easier setting. I can envision for example that a brilliant instructor in a wheelchair can continue to work without any major issue, something impossible with the traditional approach. Same of course for students. 

It is also worth to point out the enormous reduction in CO2 emission if classes are taught from home, reducing to zero the commuting time and allowing more time for research, teaching, free time, and family."

Over the four weeks we were online in the spring I got more intentional about arranging deadlines to pace the work.  I thought giving more time was helpful but sometimes it wasn't if it meant that too many things were due around the same time.  Finding a pattern for lectures & associated ""in-class"" work, labs, and homework that was regular but spread the deadlines out was important.  I extended deadlines but I made students request extensions individually and tell me what was going on.  I granted them all for just about any reason, but I think they felt a lot better if they could tell me why and communicate their struggles.

Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Rural Institution,2,101-200,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,5-6 days,Full time instructional faculty without tenure,"I moved to conducting lectures synchronously online for my two classes, which were quite different from one another, and required different strategies. For my 64-student gen-ed, I used powerpoint on Zoom, encouraged students to ask questions using the chat. I had four TAs available to supervise team-based activities once a week in breakout rooms. For breakout rooms, I first tried having supergroups where there was 1 TA/room with multiple teams in the room, but that did not work. I shifted to 1 team per breakout room, with TAs moving between a subset of rooms to check on students. There were numerous challenges, mainly to do with students being able to do modified lab-like activities in their homes - for some, this was not possible. I tried to make sure at least one person per team could do the activity, and then discuss it within their team. My one remaining exam was open-book, timed and delivered through the online system. Problems were grouped by topic. Once you opened a set of problems, you had to submit within a fixed time interval. However, the whole exam was available for 24 hours. Instead of a final, I had a paper and online presentations.

For my upper-level physics class, with 18 students, it was challenging to run a traditional lecture. I began by handwriting and uploading notes that I went through on Zoom - the students hated this, it went too fast for them. I tried purely writing on OneNote - too slow. The compromise was to handwrite and upload scanned notes before class, and then annotate them using OneNote. This worked better, but it was still hard for students to stay focused. Going forward, I would intersperse my lecture with short problems for them to do, do make the learning more active. I modified the exam to be take-home, open book, and to be completed within 48 hours.

What I took away from this experience, as a novice online instructor, but one who is comfortable with technology, is that each class needs to be tailored so that student learning outcomes are minimally affected, and are what you would like them to be."

We were initially persuaded by arguments of our colleagues that a lot of students would not be able to make synchronous classes, but we hoped a lot of students would show up for labs and Friday group work, but very few (less than 10%) did.  So students did these activities on their own or in self-organized groups.  This is an intro physics course for life science students, and our students are not as motivated as the engineering students, who did show up for group work.  So one of our big questions is what can we require, given such disparate circumstances. 

Our biggest concern going forward to the fall was using Chegg to cheat on exams.  This happened in all of our intro courses.  Exams were the biggest technical challenge:  how long of a window to give?  how to deliver the questions?  how to have students upload answers?

Generally, we didn't reorganize/rethink the course in any big way, we just used Zoom to carry on as usual, using breakout rooms for group work.

Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,1,36-50,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,Tenure-track with research expectations,"I basically took my in-person lecture and lectured via Zoom with an iPad.  These lectures were given synchronously during the regular lecture time.  However, they were also recorded.  The recorded lectures and pdfs of the lecture notes were uploaded online and available asynchronously to students.  Homework was still do at the usual time, and given weekly.  The difficulty of the homework did not decrease, although I started adding extra credit points.  The 2nd Midterm and Final Exam changed from in-person exams to take home exams.  Hence, students had more time to complete them.  The homework and exams were posted on Blackboard, and the students were asked to upload their solutions onto Blackboard as well (although they were allowed to email the solutions if it worked better.)  Then their graded homework/exams were posted back onto Blackboard.

I would like to comment on synchronous vs. asynchronous.  We had a strong push at our institution to make everything asynchronous for accessibility issues.  While accessibility is a major concern, it is possible to solve this problem by being synchronous and asynchronous.  Dropping the synchronous lectures fundamentally misunderstands out students.  This is one reason I didn't like to our teaching centers, because I felt they did not understand the needs of our students and weren't listening to faculty.  Just like faculty did not sign up for teaching online courses, students did not sign up to take online courses and it's likely they never took online courses before.  Going purely asynchronous is a gigantic disruption in their learning, as they were getting kicked off campus.  There lives centered around the rhythms of campus and then that was taken away.  It was our responsibility as faculty to give as much semblance of normality as possible, and help keep their schedules.  Additionally, these students are not used to having to set their own schedules and to expect them to do such at the same time they are kicked off campus, the economy cratered, and there was a global pandemic puts undo burden upon the students.

So what I learned:  Try to keep things as much normal as possible, and as seemless transition as possible. Do not use a huge amount new technology that the students have to learn.  Set your expectations and communicate them early.  Also, regularly communicate reminding them about homework/lectures and telling them to take care of themselves.  Everybody understood that this was less than an ideal circumstance, and I found the students responded fantastically if you showed that you understand and care a little.  Finally, do not increase or decrease your expectations for the course, but give more avenues for them to improve their grades. 

I would also like to note in the end I passed everybody who did the work.  

A note about your questions: One of the questions asked how helpful different software were for teaching.  I answered ""very helpful"" for both of them.   I would like to note that Blackboard is generally helpful even for face-to-face, but something like Zoom is only useful for online teaching.  Also, there was a question characterizing Blackboard as ""new"" but I have quite a bit of experience using it, so it is not ""new."""

Based on class poll results, almost none of my students had any prior experience with video conferencing services like Zoom, however, so I did an in-class primer prior to the official online transition. I got a lot of positive feedback from students for doing this, but it would not have been possible to do if I had relied solely on the official university-wide communications regarding if transitioning was going to occur or not. I will mention that I have a lot of 'dependents' both professionally (e.g. research staff and students, etc.) and personally- and the online transition, even with my prior experience from research settings, was extremely stressful for me as a result, and I had to essentially halt all research activities (even though my research is computational in nature and can be done remotely by both me and my research group). I estimate I put in at least 1, 18-hour work day in addition to my standard workload for about 2 months in addressing student emergencies (or even just referring them to the appropriate campus office to contact). Many of which caused major access issues for them in being able to function in an online class such as lack of high speed internet access, getting locked out of the LMS for long periods of time, lack of access to electronic devices like laptops (so some only had access to smartphones for turning in work, accessing the class website, etc.), major upheaval due to life events like job loss, seriously ill family members, and in one case eviction during a stay-at-home order.

For larger traditional content classes, I think the most important thing will be to form these small groups study groups and have them form contracts with each other on how they will contribute and be responsible to help each other learn. For our group projects, before disbanding, students had to rubric/checklist they used to evaluate themselves and their group members at 4 points in the semester.

I was not able to find sufficient information about remote, real time delivery of instructional materials (again, this was not online teaching!) so I tried my best given the conditions. Trial and error works! The biggest challenge was the lack of technological resources for students (computer, internet access, bandwidth, accessories, etc). I included specific questions about the remote experience in the class evaluations; it was not as bad as I expected, and I think I am better prepared if I have to teach remotely in the near future."
Four Year Private College/University,Master's,Urban Institution,3,21-35,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,Tenured faculty with research expectations,"Although it was relatively straightforward to transition my lectures and assignments online, I lost much of the group/peer instruction aspect and was never comfortable implementing it using our online tools."
Four Year Public College/University,Bachelor's,Rural Institution,4,51-100,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,Tenured instructional faculty,"Teaching online has been exhausting and demoralizing.  It takes the same or more time to run a class online, and while the geographic and circadian freedom an async online class allows is substantial, I don't want to do this long-term.  I think the learning online does not live up to the in-person standard, particularly because the student-student and student-faculty communication is so limited and clunky. I worry that an MBA somewhere will take Spring 2020 as an existence proof that all teaching should go online and our society (and universities) will go down the drain in the same way uber has decimated the taxi industry and airb&b has decimated real estate markets."
Two Year Public College,Associate degree,"Minority-Serving Institution,Urban Institution",3,21-35,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,Full time instructional faculty without tenure,"Worked really hard. Did not feel guided by my college.

College has made no statements regarding cheating and FERPA concerns for faculty observing students."
Four Year Public College/University,Master's,"Minority-Serving Institution,Hispanic-Serving Institution,Urban Institution",2,101-200,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,Part-time or Adjunct faculty,"1. Should have used the simulation software more rigorously.
2. I had to completely rewrite the lab manual for half the content (The online content)
3. Should have kept attendance as a graded item. (It was removed as a graded item during remote instruction)
4. I obtained good success with the online rework. I was able to engage the students with all the content of the face to face content.
5. Students adapted well to online experience.
6. Students did lose the physical context of using real devices and constructing real circuits. How great is that loss is unclear right now."
Four Year Private College/University,Ph.D.,Urban Institution,1,36-50,I have taught fully online previously.,1-2 weeks,Tenured faculty with research expectations,"Actually, it was more or less possible (it seemed) to transition our SCALE-UP class to an online virtual environment using Zoom without too much trouble.  Students were able to use breakout rooms for group work, and Zoom offers polling capability to enable clicker questions.  Students were able to capture and share their group work from whiteboard activities, and they were able to annotate questions or figures displayed by the instructor.  While I am not saying that it matched the in-class experience, it was not such a bad approximation."
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,NA,2,101-200,I have taught fully online previously.,1-2 weeks,Full time instructional faculty without tenure,"I coordinate the engineering physics sequence. We had few cases we suspect of cheating on the final exam. That one thing makes me proud but the method we used was very labor intensive. We will do something different for the fall for tests but I don't know what it is. 
The university encouraged us to be flexible with students as their internet may not have been good at home and they may have challenges - this meant we eliminated the attendance requirement for synchronous attendance. A large percentage of our team posted pre-recorded (by someone else) videos of content for students to watch and hosted some ""class time"" in person. Attendance was tiny. Students disengaged. Homework scores dropped. Faculty were discouraged by having to talk to impersonal ""black boxes"" on a screen that didn't even have student photos! And, in a class where the typical attendance would be 100 - less than 40 would attend the live sessions. My personal live sessions never had more than 10 students. We want to focus on flipping the classroom for the fall and being intentional about using breakout rooms for student engagement for the lectures. 
We did keep one component of the course ""synchronous"" which was our small group work sessions led by TAs. We doubled the TAs and used Zoom whiteboard and annotate feature. We are unlikely to have enough staffing to maintain that for the fall. 
For spring - we continued using WebAssign. Ramped up using Moodle to share videos and to do testing. Right now - in summer - I am testing Gradescope and Respondus monitor and will make a proposal to the faculty about testing plans for fall within a month."
Four Year Private College/University,Ph.D.,Urban Institution,5 or more,20-Nov,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,3-4 days,Tenured instructional faculty,I only had 8 sessions left when we went online.  We muddled through those 8 session together.
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,Hispanic-Serving Institution,1,200 or more,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,1-2 weeks,Tenure-track with research expectations,"Since I had about 250 students, with a sizable percentage in other timezones, I opted for an asynchronous class mode where I pre-recorded all lectures. I had an extra-credit quiz for each lecture to motivate students to watch them in time. I also held active discussion sessions in a variety of times where students had to turn in their work at the end. 

One of the biggest challenges for me was dealing with online examinations and all the associated complications. I think one of the biggest challenges for students was adjusting to the online mode and finding the calm and discipline needed to succeed in the class while being at home. I ended up with an abnormally wide distribution of grades."
Four Year Private College/University,Bachelor's,NA,3,21-35,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,3-4 days,Tenured faculty with research expectations,The challenges were with online labs and cheating on exams.  No one seems to have a fail-safe solution to the cheating.  Chegg was the worst offender.
Four Year Public College/University,Ph.D.,"Minority-Serving Institution,Urban Institution",1,36-50,I have never taught online or in a blended format previously.,0-2 days,Tenured faculty with research expectations,"If teaching online again, I'd prefer that students simply watch well-curated video lectures that already exist, then I use zoom to solve problems and discuss concepts with the students.  I don't know how to do this yet; I don't know what well-curated lectures I can point my students to.  I will look into this if it appears that I will be teaching online in Fall semester."
