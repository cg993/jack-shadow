I am seriously considering a career change.1 needed new equipment paid for  by mehad to learn to use new equipmentinternet at my house is problematic  often requiring me to use phone as hot spotI was familiar with Zoom from video conferencing and everyone was encouraged to use the software for remote instruction. I already used Canvas for assignments and grading, so I just increased its use for the online class. I learned some new features of Zoom, like screen annotations, breakout rooms, polling, yes/no buttons, chat, recording, and sharing YouTube videos that I integrated into classes. I already taught by annotating powerpoint slides on a tablet, so it wasn't too big of a change to use Zoom. The biggest challenge was the lack of audience feedback, so I used the yes/no buttons to ask if people understood tough concepts and used breakout rooms to drop in on 2-3 students at a time when I assigned group practice problems so that I could get some conversational feedback.Although I have taught online before I find it far inferior to a face-to-face class.  I would not have continued if not for the pandemic.  Now I will have to teach the entire fall semester online.  I am less inclined to seek fancy tools or an LMS and more concerned about making connections to students.Teaching online is helpful, and I am planning to incorporate it more. The problem is the lack of proper assessment tools - the students cheat. Pass/fail option allowed students with marginal/zero knowledge to pass my class, which normally would nor happen. Online teaching was not an issue - these students had poor performance before switching to online teaching.My online class was the advanced physics laboratory.  A large point of the class is learning how to operate an experiment to obtain reasonable data that can be analyzed.  That is 50% of the class, the rest is report writing. The closure of campus was late enough that all the students had the data for two of the three experiments they normally do during the semester.  They had an option to do a third experiment with an informal report, or turn one of the two into a formal report (for example, to submit to a journal).  The oral report component of the class was eliminated.  My experience suggests that this course cannot be offered without access to the campus and the laboratory. We were fortunate that most of the hands-on work had been completed at the closure.  If something on line were offered, it would be a different course.  There is no way around that.My transition to teaching online took a very simple approach: Do on Zoom and with a webcam what I was doing in person on the board. I found that this worked to some extent and was not a disaster, but in the future I will find more ways to communicate with the students to get them engaged, and to vary the pace and delivery. It seems to me that this is both more important than when teaching in person, and easier to do than expected.In Large-enrollment courses (150+) with a single instructor (and maybe 2 LAs) it becomes difficult to assess students.  Without additional instructor capacity, hand-grading of assignments to give feedback to students becomes unreasonable, and no good resource exists to ensure that students aren't accessing things like Chegg during online exams (additionally, since students weren't submitting things like this before the transition, it didn't seem fair to switch how they were being assessed in the middle of the semester).  Things like the lockdown browser only go so far, and requirements that students have a webcam so they can be \"remotely proctored\" have huge equity concerns given the rushed nature of this, and even for the upcoming fall (have you SEEN the price of webcams lately?  They're sold out everywhere)....the important part of the class was an asynchrnous teamwork element, and that became even more evident when we made the transition.My in person class is as interactive as I can make a large lecture class.  I use ConcepTests, lots of demos (and require the students to predict the results of the demos) and lots of simulations.  I would wander the class and engage students in 1-1 discussions during conceptests.  This interactivity was much more limited when teaching on-line.Exams were particularly troubling, because there were not enough safeguards against cheating.I was teaching an upper-level core undergraduate lab course. Transitioning online was basically not possible -- the level of the experiments is not appropriate for student work at home, simulations, or virtual labs. I had originally planned to live-stream (and record) myself doing the experiments, but access to our campus was completely cut off, so that wasn't a possibility. If we have to (or choose to) teach online in the future, that may be a possibility, but any online teaching is a poor substitute for an upper-level lab course.An important lesson learned by the entire department was that Chegg.com can be used in real-time to cheat on online exams. We found our unique test questions answered on Chegg with matching student solutions. In one of my classes, the transition was relatively easy as I was already running the class in a flip format with lecture videos, mastering physics for homework, iLearn, etc. The main transition was using Zoom for class meetings and to supervise online exams.I have learned that I can provide recorded material to the student and work problems with them in \"face to face\" settings.I was already doing it for 20+ years.  It was abrupt bit the challenges were invigorating!  We have been working for ~3 years on an online BA in Physics.  This only empowers that.  My faculty (I'm chair) struggle with understanding the connection.  (sigh)The places where I have excelled in the past center around student interaction and helping lead them in their learning.  These methods did not help me get the students to log in, or have better internet, or motivate them to do the things I was able to do with a good rapport.  I spent more time as a gate-keeper, and the skills of teaching took a back seat as I spent more and more time adjusting assignments and fighting with technology.  I feel students had a similar experience as the same effort on their part would less learning, as a larger percentage of time was spent on technology issues and not on the material itself.I recorded video lectures using my laptop and posted them to youtube. It went OK. The grades were higher in the online part. I suspect some of the students cheated on the online exams. I found my exam questions posted on Chegg shortly after the exam. I also used a lot of Physics Girl videos to augment my lectures. Overall, the semester turned out pretty good, but I would rather teach face-to-face.Teaching synchronously, online caused some anxiety for the first few weeks, but then I settled in. Having to record the lectures as a backup option in case of students' technical difficulties also caused some anxiety, since it is much more likely that mistakes or embarrassing moments are forever recorded for posterity.Honestly I had seen it coming for about a month so started to make the changes.  The main challenge was the need for the student to have access to specialized computers and software to do their data reduction for the class.  Our CSR's had already been exploring VM's to let students reach the packages they needed from anywhere in the world. That took care of one aspect of the lab class.  The second part I totally had to modify.  The class required hands-on telescope time with our robotic research telescopes.  That kind of died with leaving school. For fall I'm looking at some modifications that could let the students have at least part of the experience.The transition wasn't that difficult since many of the resources were available online anyway (homework, turning in assignments, etc.). The main change was moving student contact time to Zoom and in-class discussions from small groups to Zoom breakout rooms.  The major challenge for both me and the students was the reduced face-to-face social contact. I also found that it took significantly more of my time to provide an effective online teaching/learning experience.A lot of communication and understanding of students’ needs is required so not only do they not get stressed, but so you don’t get stressed, too. You’ve got to learn to accept imperfections and be honest with your students about the difficulty you are having while also acknowledging yhrr err it difficulties.I have small children and a full research program.  I had no child care for 5 weeks and struggled to maintain 30-35 hours/week when I could work.  I knew I had to limit my class prep time, which was a factor in my pedagogical choices.  I think it also made me particularly sensitive to similar challenges my students faced.  I saw too much focus in many of my colleagues on maintaining standards and preventing cheating and not enough on having some human compassion because our students are going through a lot.  I am creeped out by Respondus.  Students did not sign up to be video taped, let alone for a prof to change policies and mandate that they be video taped in their own home.  I think it's one thing if they knew at the beginning of the semester, but it's not fair to do that to students mid-semester.  I think it's better to accept some level of cheating.White board was ineffective.  I had to type out all of the equations and imbed them in powerpointThere was a massive amount of cheating in the on-line class.   I think that both myself and my institution need to better address the question of cheating in unproctored on-line classes.    This experience gives me a very negative impression of the academic integrity of on-line classes, unless some serious attempt to proctor is done.My class was a graduate seminar class on \"professional skills\" (networking, grant writing, career choices, CVs, ethics, presentation skills) and as such was easily transitioned to online.I am also the department chair so I have observed some difficulties faculty in my department have experienced.  Namely, lack of student interest, lack of student technology at home needed for online courses, rampant cheating using Chegg, students unwilling to engage in the online format, the difficulty in giving synchronous classes, the almost impossibility of giving an upper division lab.The entire problem with a flipped class based approach is that the students don't have good skills toattempt various things in an independent manner;  they actually need to be trained.I could never find the right technology to produce good recorded lectures from home (graduate course, lectures are recorded, scheduled lecture time is for questions and discussion). It is frustrating. It takes a huge amount of time, and I have become infinitely inefficient. I can't get any useful feedback from students -- the material is challenging and students seem much less willing to ask questions even though our meetings are specifically for that).  Attendance at lectures (question/discussion) is low, around 30%.What do you want to understand? Ask a couple of classes of students and 10 instructors, you will see what they think. The only ones who think this was great are the school administrators, because they think they might save money (as if we could compete with online colleges) and the sycophants who try to become the next deanlet by preaching  \"best teaching practices\".I honestly think those that are having more difficulties with teaching online were using more antiquated teaching methods (lectures, textbooks, not leveraging LMS, etc.). We have been teaching with a fully hybrid flipped classroom for years where the only difference between a f2f and online class is whether you're physically there or not. All resources, homework, and support were available online before this hit. We even had our online, hybrid, and f2f students attending the same synchronous lectures, interacting in breakout groups in a mixed form. We've had the option to attend or not by creating asynchronous assignments for a couple years. Our vision, which we've been working towards for about 5 years, was to offer a completely al carte model where you pick this week if you're going to attend lecture, lab, or recitation in person or engage remotely. We form groups to maximize diversity across all chosen paths.  For our class the transition was fairly smooth. The one place it has been difficult, and we are failing our f2f (remote) students, is labs. We have physical labs for the online students but those kits are expensive and take time to prepare so we didn't go that route for our f2f students who moved to remote learning. They are using simulations and there is evidence that they are not working as well as the online students who are doing physical experiments.Good in-depth exams for advanced physics classes are extremely hard to administrate.I have found online teaching to be liberating. Students continue to interact with me during lectures, albeit now in multiple forms, such as online chat, texting, as well as verbal interaction. I find that (potentially) anonymous and non-verbal modes of interaction encourage more students to participate spontaneously without my having to solicit their input. These additional communication channels also give me more freedom to interact with students during lectures.Online teaching also enabled me to continue to hold lectures even while I was sick with Covid-19. In the future, this will be my go-to approach to handling illness or travel, rather than asking a colleague to fill in or having to reschedule a lecture.It was the undergraduate advanced lab, so the main challenge was in creating data analysis projects to replace our in-lab experiments.  Colleagues donated data sets, and it all worked out quite well for most of the class - in fact, 93% of the class advocated making a permanent change to incorporate data analysis projects in the syllabus.  However, about 25% of the lab groups had weaker programming skills, and needed a great deal of assistance.Hybrid class was easy to transition to online class.  Labs were possible because online labs had already been developed for another online class.I used Skype to give the lectures. Students could give feedback either via the chat or by talking directly. Only one student was comfortable with asking questions using his voice. These lectures were  also recorded and remained available on Skype for 30 days. So students that were unable to attend the lecture in real time could use the recordings.Maintaining a constant presence was very helpful for my students.  I tried to post on Teams a few times a day, often just sharing interesting new astronomy discoveries, a daily series of useless of facts, and reminders about assignments and tips on studying.  While we suspended our regular class evaluations, I had ~50% participation in an informal assessment survey on the course management page.  It was very useful.  Students indicated focusing on studying was harder, they had to work harder to stay on top of things, they preferred in-person, and that my changes to the course and my engagement was very helpful, especially when compared to other classes.One thing that greatly helped my transition was I was already using a technology-heavy classroom, with platforms for digitally enhanced teaching in-person (learning catalytics, Mastering Physics, teaching via mixed electronic media).  This helped in moving my in-person lectures online.  On the other hand, I struggled to get students to continue communicating with each other and forming ad-hoc study groups and support networks, and if teaching online again I would very much like to make this an active part of the class, both to prevent incoming biases of who already has support networks (e.g. family tutoring or greek life) that tend to bias studying away from students who are not already well-connected with resources coming in to the class.Prior to Covid I was using Sakai to deliver prepared (LaTex for equations) notes and receive homeworks. I recorded each lecture and posted it to sakai after class with my slides narrated using iSpring Converter Pr. In Covid, the only change I made was to lecture on Zoom instead of in class. Student questions came in the Chat window at about the same rate as in class. I ran the final exam in real-time on Zoom.Regular class was taught in flipped-class format with weekly pre-class assignments and a mixture of online homework (WebAssign) and written homework for grading. Face-to-face in-class time is focused on multiple-choice questions answered via Plickers, and group problem-solving sessions with TAs and instructor circulating among students engaging them with socratic questioning. Solutions to problems and questions projected on a white screen are discussed on a chalk blackboard to the side. For online transition, pre-class assignments and homework maintained same structure, except written homeworks were scanned by the students and uploaded to cloud storage (OneDrive) using a Google form. Synchronous online classes used Zoom meeting sharing a split screen showing a virtual keyboard implemented with ExplainEverything running on iPad with Apple Pencil, side-by-side with a pdf with problems being given, mimicking face-to-face class setup. Multiple-choice answers were assessed in real time using \"Polls for Canvas\"app, and problem-solving sessions were implemented using Zoom breakout rooms of 3-4 students, where TA and Instructors jump from room to room using the same socratic questioning strategy. 2h in-class exams transitioned to 3h take-home exams to be scanned and submitted for grading, with an explicit request that students abide by code of conduct and do not search for answers on the internet or consult among them or with third-parties. An appeal for honesty and fairness to their fellow colleagues was also made during the class before the exam. Score distributions for these take-home exams largely followed similar trends to in-class exams and written homework performance, thus showing no evidence of cheating. Course evaluations were identical to the ones obtained for first part of the course which was taught face-to-face in its entirety (4.8/5.0 group median), though 73% of students responded this semester compared to 54% last semester. Main shortcoming of online class was the inability to maintain Breakout Room student assignment from class to class, due to my university/college/department not having an institutional license with Zoom and instead relying in less flexible technologies like WebEx. This hindered peer instruction, as students would have to \"break the ice\" anew for the first group problem in every online class.The class I taught last semester than transitioned to online (about 2/3 of the way through) was a small upper-level undergrad class with 6 students, which made the transition and the ability to lecture online much easier. In addition, in lieu of written exams, conducted one-on-one oral exams with each of them (via zoom), which turned out to be a better way of gauging their understanding than written exams, and something I might consider in the future even when face-to-face classes can resume.I tried to teach very similarly to face-to-face. Students were already adjusted to that from the first part of the semester. I used Zoom breakout rooms for group work.Survey advice: put all the questions on one page or have a progress indicator. I almost abandoned this as it had no clear ending for too long.One can do it, if necessary, but this is not real teaching/learning (at least for classes that involve critical thinking, not simply acquiring a well defined set of skills/\"information units\"/useful \"knowledge tools\". I may, of course, be wrong; if this is the case, I'm expendable - together with most of the physics faculty from most of the universities. Online teaching (for, e.g., graduate physics courses), if it is really meaningful and desirable, can be done most efficiently in a centralized manner by a relatively small number of highly qualified people. Otherwise, it should be avoided, even by taking some risks.I am a physics teaching assistant, so the courses I teach are part of a larger course taught by the main instructor.  The way recitations work in my course, however, is that they're twice weekly lectures, just in a smaller group.  When we transitioned to online classes, the main instructor for the course moved to using Khan Academy to provide the students with some instructional material.  While the Khan Academy materials do have useful information, they aren't really full lectures, so I ended up taking over the bulk of the lecturing responsibilities.  I would provide a lecture during our regular course time via Zoom and then edit and upload the video footage from the lecture so that students who could not tune in during our regular class time could still access the material.  Based on emails that my students sent to me as well as course evaluations, my students really valued this course structure and felt like it kept things as close to normal as they could have been.  Some of them were a bit frustrated with the Khan Academy videos and wanted their regular lectures by the main instructor as well.  So, from my limited experience and small sample size, I found that providing a synchronous Zoom lecture done as a normal, at the whiteboard lecture, with an asynchronous video uploaded afterward seemed to meet the needs of the students well, but using prerecorded videos from other institutions was a bit less helpful.While the transition was abrupt and we (the instructors) had to scramble to figure out how to make things work, especially in terms of group work (tutorials, labs), it really helped that the students and instructors all already knew each other. This allowed us to maintain a strong sense of community and a high level of interaction after the transition.  This would have been much harder to achieve with a group of students who had never met each other. Indeed, in a previous experience teaching an asynchronous MOOC, we tried to add synchronous office-hours type sessions each week, but very few students participated. We also tried to create community through the discussion board, but did not have a lot of success in getting students to interact with each other.It was easy once I figured out how to make breakout rooms in Teams so that student could go into small groups.I like teaching synchronously and have already been using lecture capture (for students who miss class), LearningCatalytics, MasteringPhysics, and an e-text. The latter 3 were essential for online teaching, so they did not have to change. I found most students did not participate synchronously, so LearningCatalytics for real-time TPS questions was not very useful (and thus was no longer graded for participation). Delivering exams was problematic. We had access to Respondus' Lockdown Browser and Monitor, so I tried to use both. Most students could use them adequately, though neither turned out very useful in attempting to detect cheating. I could only assume that students were less willing to attempt cheating, and they will adapt and attempt to cheat in the future (they are easily side-stepped by using another device). I was able to deliver multiple-choice self-graded exams through Blackboard.We have used FlipitPhysics for many years as our textbook and online homework system, so we were lucky - it already has lectures built in that we had been requiring of our students anyway. I initially relied on this, Zoom office hours (daily), and detailed notes that I posted. I have since added a voice-over to the notes. I spend a lot of time (much more than pre-Covid) answering emails from and about students. I have also seen my service work and time in meetings skyrocket.I'm teaching a special program for a select group of incoming undergraduates (first years and transfer students). It's very low-level, but focused on content that's research-aligned, rather than intro physics.  I had hoped that there would be some good interactive web content or videos available, but I was dismayed at the options (nothing interactive, also nearly everything featured a white male expert), so I decided it was worth my time to create more of the content than I'd originally intended.I had to record my lectures before the actual classes met, that was like 3 times per week. Also I had to prepare multiple choice questions. Other than that it was a nice transition. I  love online teaching since it gives me more time to spend with my family as well as teach what I love to others.I ranked the usefulness of tools such as zoom classmeetings and online grading from the perspective of whether I could teach the class without them.  I want to be clear, however, that I had not choice to use these tools and more importantly, *NONE* of them supplant face to face instruction and hands on laboratory experiences.My students turn off their cameras during zoom sessions. I find it very hard to gauge their engagement without visual queues. Student performance on Homework is a bit below historical averages but test performance is statistically indistinguishable from previous years.Everyone had video off and muted during class.  After the first week, it was very difficult to get anyone to engage in conversation or questions.As a TA i didnt have much control. We recorded the expirements and had students watch them and go about their usual work.My class used a lot of blackboard anyways since it was a hybrid class so that wasn't really an issue. Mostly my second half of the semester is hands on work, so the class lacked in that aspect.The main challenge was finding an effective way to administer online exams. Exams were implemented through my LMS but I could not be 100% sure about cheating, although I used strategies such as using free-response questions, selecting questions from a random pool and so on.It took me 3-4 times more time to prepare online video lectures compared to preparing for a face-to-face lecture. It is very important to me to see the students' faces during class, how they react, behave, etc. Without such instant feedback, it feels impossible to judge how much they are able to follow the lectures and I cannot adjust the pace and level accordingly. It feels like I'm talking at the wall, which is demotivating for me too, something that affects my teaching badly. I find it important to see how they are doing on a regular basis, which again is difficult without meeting them. I need to zoom with them a lot individually because although I have regular weekly discussions, they sometimes cannot make it due to their up-side-down schedules (no structure provided by the regularities of classes and discussions). Thus, to accommodate all their needs I have to make (a lot) more time for them as before. Online teaching feels like cheating them, not providing them with the university experience that very much relies on communication and interaction.Given technology disparities, the difficulties of studying in some homes, and the chaotic schedules we unexpectedly have, it is more important than ever to afford students the opportunity to participate asynchronously.Students still very much want the interactions with the instructor. Talking to me in a short video conference is better received than sending students to a resource page - at least according to the evaluations that were submitted for this spring semester.Shared screens and breakout rooms on Zoom work surprisingly well.  It would be MUCH better if more students could write on the screen (e.g. from a tablet) rather than with a mouse.My face to face class is very traditional. I do not use chalk and chalkboard, but I do use a document writer and large screen (a digital projector) and write out the notes with the class and talk to the class as I write. Even face-to-face, before COVID19, I post all lecture notes, homework, quiz, and exam solutions in Blackboard. All students know their exact grade at all times. Transitioning online was easy, simply point a web cam at a legal pad and start teaching on Zoom, same as regular class (except they don't see me and I can not do live demos). Students appreciated that they did not have to learn anything new tech for the transition in my classes. The BIGGEST problem with online teaching is the cheating on the exams and ways to police it to ensure no cheating. Overall, despite the ~1/3 of the class taught online, it was a success. Some comments below indicate that even though it is a traditional course, students like the delivery method (before and after COVID19). Here are two comments from students on the end of the semester teaching evaluations: \"What a great course! I had come into this course with a prior love for physics from high school and horror stories of college physics. I understand the horror, but the fun and newfound knowledge definitely outweighs the nastier parts including equations. This course rekindled my love for learning. I had never been so proud to show my parents how I could calculate the torque, final velocity, and possibly the angular momentum of something under super specific conditions. MMP and Written HW were components that I used to check my learning after a week of classes--that system was very efficient and productive for me. The individual and group quizzes were also really helpful. I was wary of the group ones, but I found myself studying harder so I wouldn't let them down in case one of them couldn't study. Exams were hard, but they weren't completely foreign. All in all, this was a really fantastic course that definitely requires TIME for studying, but each one of those hours is so very much worth the time put into it.\" and comment 2, \"What an awesome instructor. I found myself comparing my other professors to him. The material was difficult, and memorizing some equations/constants/mathematical relations could easily be grueling, but he made it anything but. The live demos were amazing, and showed me how much I don't know. He's a wealth of knowledge, and is uber flexible in the way he teaches--anybody could learn even if they knew absolutely nothing about science.\"Need to learn strategies for making the class more interactive during synchronous online lectures.I made video lectures on Panopto by making notes on my iPad as I would on the backboard. I also showed various PowerPoint slides when appropriate with recorded narrative. These were to be watched asynchronously. I used canvas to deliver the lessons. Problem sets were assigned and synchronous time was optional And used more a San office hour to explain concepts and help with homework. They started out well attended but dwindled over time. I was under tenure review and was observed for evaluation so the entire experience was deeply traumatizing.I started off fairly excited about the opportunities, but I rapidly became concerned about two students who didn't have internet access for synchronous classes. My assessment strategies relied on achieving mastery and doing oral re-takes after exams. So I threw all that out the window. The first 4 weeks, I managed to record and post lectures and even gave an at home quiz during typical class time. I managed to give a 3rd exam, but worried tremendously how stressed and anxious students might be feeling. I become severely discouraged by my failings as an instructor and caring for my students. I ended up offering everyone an A for the work they had completed up to that point. It was a 2nd semester Quantum class, so I'm not concerned that I'm setting them up for failure by limiting this content as they likely won't need it to continue their education. Just really felt like I was equal parts helping them and failing them. What a shit show.It is vastly inferior to in-person teaching.Since the students didn't sign up for distance education and we did eight weeks (of 14) of regular instruction (which uses LON-CAPA for online homework and Top Hat for in-class responses), I tried to maintain an experience as close to the regular classroom experience as before, with synchronous lectures at our usual class time that were recorded for those that couldn't follow synchronously. I eventually figured out how to set up break-out rooms for the in-class activities that we used to do at our 9 person tables, but it was very awkward to visit them in Microsoft Teams. In talking with my student advisees (I have about 20), the quasi-synchronous way that most faculty in our department adopted was more popular (at least for this very odd semester) than the more fully online approaches that other departments tried. The diversity of different approaches that they got across departments was confusing to them. Our faculty are preparing to go more online for fall, especially with lab materials and demos (which did not transition well to the distance learning format).Asynchronous lectures/ synchronous group work supervised by prof and TA (10-11am and 11-12pm eastern US). Zoom breakouts for group work.Tried to cause as little disruption as possible for students - kept to same class times, same online homework system, just moved to Canvas-based quizzes.It was an upper-division lab class (wasn't one of the options) so the lab work did not translate at all.  Fortunately, we were in the last 5 weeks of semester and the students had completed 5 out of 7 experiments, so we just had to make it work.  We gave students the data for the two experiments that they didn't complete themselves, and then reduced the points for those so their grade reflected more of what they had done at the beginning of the semester.  We made a lot of videos to explain the physics principles and also showing how the experiments are performed and linked them all through canvas.There is a big difference between emergency transition and planned transition (such as for the upcoming fall). Essentially all is forgiven in an emergency, but things will be higher stakes in the fall.I made my own video recordings of lectures.  The exams changed from in-class, closed book with partial credit to online, open book, multiple choice exams.  My greatest concern is that students will cheat on the online exams, having a friend help them.  I see no good way to stop this in the current environment.Chaos and stress!It was a work in progress.  Each session was completely rewritten for online instruction.  I believed going into each lesson that it was my best work.  I learned something from each class that I wanted to improve.  So the lessons I taught at the end of the semester took advantage of lessons learned, and were much more effective than my initial online lessons.Shut Chegg down.We're quarter system, so we transitioned over spring break (and are still teaching). Everybody and their grandmother sent out \"how to teach online\" links to hundreds of resources, which was completely overwhelming and as a result not helpful at all. (Not to mention that many of these contradicted each other. And none included the useful info that my university _had_ a template for online courses I could have just pulled into Canvas.)Most of my prep time was not spent on the class I responded about in the survey (highest-enrollment one, a lecture), but rather on figuring out how to run our lab class remotely.I feel like we had so many people trying to help that it was counterproductive. From my associate dean \"trying to help\" by changing course fees in ways that we had to undo, to Inside Higher Ed publishing uncountable numbers of \"how to teach online\" articles... like, can you imagine showing up to MIT as a freshman and having every single physics professor on campus come by your dorm room telling you how to learn physics all at once? Individually they may be brilliant and insightful and helpful, but all together you just have to shut every one of them out and ignore it all just to get by.As for the results, it's confirmed my opinion that online sucks. Even done right, as I'm prepping to do in fall, it just sucks. The connection with students just isn't there, and all the messages, discussion boards, and Zoom office hours in the world don't change that.I can only reliably cover about 70% of the same material in the same time.  I keep feeling like a friend who wrote an asynchronous online course.  When asked how it was going with students, he replied, \"I pretend to teach them, and they pretend to learn.\"The Red Skelton character Clem Kadidlehopper was asked how he spelled his name.  \"Wrong, every time!\" was his answer.   Sometimes that is what teaching online feels like.preparing video material for students is quite a bit of work but worth the effort. I'll probably do this for future classes too (even face-to-face ones)I happened to be team teaching, my colleague and I tried to keep the transition as \"smooth\" as possible (least changes for the students). We slowed our tempo a little, and were more generous with small issues like late homework, but there were not many. HW: Homework was scanned and submitted online pre and post transition. No change. We slightly reduced the difficulty and length after transition due to loss of good study sessions (below)EXAMS: 1st midterm was evening, in-class.  2nd midterm and final (post transition) were done same time scale, online (using the same scan method as homework.) Students \"Zoomed\" in so we could communicate during the exam (and see them). Went smoothly, no indication of cheating, no complaints, few issues. We use \"2-stage\" (group) exams pre transition, but decided to lose that after transition. LECTURES: Lectured MWF@9 AM. Lecture capture system is in the room for after-class viewing available all term.  Continued to lecture via Zoom,  (continued after transition, I was able to go in and use that same room, so Asynchronous videos were same as before) Live attendance dropped significantly, by on average a factor of 2 after the transition. Students' viewing of lecture capture videos increased somewhat from about 20% of my students  regularly viewing to about 35%... CLICKER QUESTIONS: Stopped after transition. Asked the questions during live Zoom, but little student interaction (just responses on Zoom chat) IN-CLASS SMALL GROUP ACTIVITIES: Typically had one (or two) 15-20 minute activities/week before transition. Completely stopped after transition.STUDY-SESSIONS: We had 3 hrs/week of staffed study sessions in the building. Pre transition about 30% of the class came. Post transition we continued via zoom, but only a handful (5%) showed up regularly.Student evaluations were extremely strong, they liked how we did it. But, only half the students evaluated! I lost about 5% of my class (dropped) after the transition, more than usual. No more students than usual failed (just a couple). Students could opt for P/F after the final, I don't know how many chose this, it goes through the registrar's office. But our grade distribution was similar to past terms, with a small number (5%) of D's and F's.I started transitioning the class (along with the most pedagogy-focused of my colleagues) before the official announcement of online teaching. I grounded my choices in assessment theory and a thorough understanding of what it means to exist online. I was already using many of my D2L tools to support in-person learning (D2L quizzes to facilitate Just-In-Time Teaching, for example), and was frustrated that much of the energy went into technologically making being online possible and no energy went into being online an educational environment (at a Teaching and Learning level). I am concerned that we didn't serve students well and that they're not going to be willing to engage with online education in the future.One positive aspect of online teaching: the zoom chat window feature led to far more questions during lecture than we had received in face-to-face instructionWe learned some hard lessons about the difficulties of administering online exams in terms of cheating. If possible, I would have preferred to eliminate exams altogether (or at least, eliminate timed and non-open-book exams) for this teaching format. I'll probably try to do that for the upper-level class I'll be teaching next semester, if we continue with online instruction. We were already using Gradescope to grade exams, but we switched to using it as a homework- and exam-hosting platform as well. It was the best solution we found for letting students work collaboratively via screen sharing, since most did not have tablets that they could use for digitial whiteboards.We are on the quarter system. I had zero days to implement a last quiz and a final exam to my class of 300+ students at the end of winter quarter (early March) and had to forego most of the rest of the laboratory part of the class since it is meant to be hands-on. I performed my lecture in front of an empty classroom and did the demos for the video, posted the video.  This quarter, spring quarter, they are savvy graduate students so there is less pressure and we are all used to video meetings for my research which is international and based in Europe and elsewhere (particle physics). So it has been pretty easy and the class is small.I'm spending an extra 10 hours a week writing up detailed course notes and slides, especially for students with limited bandwidth for watching lectures.  This is not sustainable.  One surprising note: I'm getting at least as many questions now, during synchronous lectures, as in an in-person class; a lot of students really like the Zoom \"chat\" feature for this.I took my planned presentations for class and broke them up into 3–10 minute videos, punctuated by single-question zero-stakes quizzes that filled in for my iClicker questions. I had recommended days by which students would get through the videos. Overall, it seemed to go okay, but I was so overwhelmed creating all of the videos that I was not as aware of students' actual performance in the class. Exams were done on ETA with a time limit and access to notes and the textbook. Performance on exams was well above in-person exams, but the style of exams, access to other resources, and additional time present multiple variables, so I can't really constrain how students' learning outcomes changed in the online version of the course.Exams became open-book online, because we did not have remote proctoring software initially available and did not want honest students disadvantaged. . This reduced the incentive to understand principles. Instead I saw an even greater reliance on trying to 'pattern match' exam questions with previous problems. Hopefully we will have a reliable remote proctoring system in place for the fall and can return to the 'single formula sheet' rule for exams.it was ok, but my tablet writing skills are far worse than my chalkboard skills.  We missed out on a lot of hands on demos I would have liked to try.  I can suggest things in their homes, but it is very hard to know if people would have access to things I might consider common household items.  I would not want to feel I caused another trip to a grocery store (which is likely by bus) for students.  I would say I managed teaching this way, but I would not say I was happy with how it went.I would also like to add that many of your questions are very poorly described.   For example \"what is the largest class you have taught\" like this semester?  or ever?  and I tried to comment near the 'rate how good this thing was' question as I don't know what I am supposed to compare it to.  None of this is as good as in person meetings, but these online tools often do a good job at something.  I am happy with how zoom worked (not so with ms teams, skype for business or blackboard).  In short, I am not sure if I have answered the questions you thought you were asking.I personally think that very large (>400 in my case) courses were easier to transition as many of the parts of the course must be automated already. For example, homework must already be online. I already had a repository for lecture recordings with which students were familiar as well as a forum. Having taught smaller classes, I think that would require more of a transition.We used Zoom, but I had lots of difficulty with upload speed. Would have liked to pre-record some lecture slides for important topics but did only a few, due to lack of time. I teach very interactively in person, but found that quite difficult online.Have already lots of handouts and tutorials for this class, which I now posted instead of distributing on paper. I already posted lots of resources  in canvas during the face-to-face time, so students were used to going online regularly. Homework (MasteringPhysics) was already online as were the readiness assessment tests.Besides the course, I teach the associated lab and a Supplemental Instruction course for the same students, so I have a lot of contact and I knew the students from last semester. The established learning community feeling helped keeping students engaged. I used all my courses as entry points: SI and labs used breakout rooms so there was still small group interaction. I already used online readiness assessments which allow students to ask questions and me to connect one-on-one with them. I put in a lot of my time (from the announcement to go online up to the end of the semester), but the transition was fairly smooth for the students. I am proud I did not lose anyone in this course.Challenge was to design exams that can be administered online; I do not believe in online proctoring (there are still many ways to cheat and it intrudes privacy). My normal exam style questions include many free response questions with sub-questions, which I felt do not work online. I am not satisfied with multiple choice exams, so I needed to be creative. I missed an online option for clickers (had I-clicker before). Zoom polls do not record who responded how.It's a challenge.  I love teaching face to face and I am old fashioned in that I don't use online HW or tests, so I ended up grading a ton of stuff that each student sent to me online.  It's way too much work, but worth the sacrifice to give the students what i think they need.  I filmed video lectures in rapid fire so that they would have those to watch.  I will do it again for Physics II (majors) and Stat. Mech. for this fall.  I'll have to use virtual labs this fall.  We had finished most of the labs in the spring course face-to-face, and I just said the hell with the rest of them because they aren't all that great anyway.  The poor students looked so demoralized in the Zoom sessions (used to help them solve physics problems).Students liked my recorded lecture videos, including the ability to replay them. So content delivery went OK. It's not possible to assure academic integrity in online courses that use endpoint examinations (known workarounds are widely available for defeating proctoring software). As a result, I am trying to transition to more authentic means of assessment, such as recorded video presentations with Q & A, etc. Kits from Hands on Labs (HoL) would have met my learning objectives for labs, but HoL production bottlenecks and added student costs took them off the table. As a result, this summer, I will try conducting synchronous labs from home. Students will be responsible for specifying the parameters of my experiment runs (e.g., how much mass they want me to add to a cart, etc.). Not sure how this will go. I think it will insure engagement. Will try to make it fun - I've enlisted my wife to be my lab assistant!I learned that online teaching is a poor substitute for f2f teaching. Less than half of the students are learning anything useful. Hope we can get back to doing what we are very good at doing - teach f2f.1. I believe I still have a lot to learn and to improve regarding my on-line teachings. 2. Some students did much better during the on-line part of my class as they could not work and were at home most of the time, so I did not have compete with work for their attention. 3. Other students got in financial trouble and worked 14 hour/day during the last three weeks of the semester having not enough time to work on the homework. 4. Other students got a lot of issues with anxiety. 5. All of my students got a lot of value for their tuition during the stay at home order and learned stuff that about adaptability and flexibility that we do not normally expose our student to.Preparing an online lecture is much more time-consuming than an in-person lecture.I attempted to make the course as flexible as possible in case my students (many of whom are caregivers, parents, have part- to full-time jobs) were unable to continue synchronous attendance. I held lectures at the regular meeting times and recorded them, posting the recording after class and adding closed-captioning. I also posted the notes I went over in class each day, plus supplemental videos on concepts we were covering. Even though I'm at a MSI (with 2/3 women undergraduates), most physics classes remain predominately white and male. In general, my white male students continued to perform well in the course after the transition, while many of my women students and students of color struggled due to lower levels of privilege and access; e.g., to high-speed internet, time to devote to classes due to being \"essential personnel\" with increased work hours, family care obligations, and loss of in-person help at office hours. I fear this pandemic is going to disproportionately set back minoritized students, leaving a mark that continues the inequity and lack of representation already seen in Physics.I spoke at length with my students about their experience, and based on our collective wisdom, I think thatwhile on-line teaching may have some advantages (snazzy demos, nice graphics, etc.) it does not have the advantages that eye contact and real time, face-to-face interaction with the class does, at least for advanced physics courses. Possibly for other courses, or in other disciplines, a hybrid model amy have an advantage.From student responses it is extremely important to be synchronous. It provides structure for the students and helps keep them engaged. Numerous students mentioned this in emails. I taught both quantum mechanics and general relativity this way.I was not only teaching a large (>100) person intro class, but it was one of many sections and we all had to make coordinated decisions. Therefore, I found myself doing a Zoom-proctored, Moodle-delivered exam that was not my choice of evaluation. We had no time to test and make good decisions, and it was too hard to come to consensus remotely. For my own class this fall, I will move completely away from a proctored exam structure, and towards frequent, smaller-stakes, and more standards-based evaluations. Neither students nor faculty were prepared for the situation, and little material was taught or learned well once we went to online teaching.The greatest challenge for me was gauging real-time how students were following the lecture.Assessment (especially exams) is the biggest challenge. Faculty *as well as* students are very concerned about cheating, which is rampant.I transitioned to teaching online years ago and I appreciate having multiple years to learn Canvas, work with Zoom, and experiment with other online teaching tools.  The COVID-19 crisis has forced instructors to confront a steep learning curve in a very short period, so kudos are deserved to all instructors who have navigated that challenge successfully.  Still, our successful response today rests heavily on the shoulders of teaching innovations and technology refinements that have been accelerating over the past decade.  Without those, the transition would not have been possible.Having taught online courses in the past, and since I had video-making experience and software and the needed tech hardware too, I was lucky to have great peace of mind going into the remote teaching phase (which for us was the last 5 weeks of our semester, 9 weeks having been completed face-to-face and one week cancelled to create a 2-week \"spring break\" for preparations.Here is an important phrase for you and everyone to consider: Remote TEACHING is easy enough; however I found that Remote ASSESSMENT is nearly impossible to do reliably.  I'm not seeing enough discussion about that.  Chegg.com and the likes are a big problem for the STEM classes.Apart from expensive tablet platforms, such as iPad, there is no good tool to write equations and draw diagrams or figures. In physics, this is by far the greatest impediment in delivering the material. Online instruction cannot be easily adapted to a dynamic teaching style in which the instructor draws the students in the discussion.Four physics instructors teaching the same class - no hope of agreeing on a way to transition. It was everybody for themselves.I learned that teaching online is NOT what it is cracked up to be.  Most of my students need more face-to-face time, not less.  If we are to establish a \"community-of-learners\" online is NOT the way to do it.  And, a number of students have figured out how to \"game the system\" (cheat)  to inflate their grades.  This is unfair to serious students.  And, I am uncomfortable \"passing\" students who are clearly under performing and under prepared to advance.  This puts an enormous burden on faculty teaching follow-on courses and degrades the college degree.  It certainly does not convey to the student their deficiencies, as well as, and undermining the purpose of college and the college experience.  It feeds into the perception that college is a \"credentialing\" process not an educational process.I had to lower my expectations somewhat and make virtual labs that were probably not as rigorous as I would have been in the classroom. I also had to be understanding of the students technology situations. The students did entirely buy in though. The result was much higher grades than I typically give.By far the most important aspect in the transition was to make myself available for the students on Zoom as often as possible. Recording the lectures helps. New platforms help (though I would argue that complexity should be minimized). However, letting the students know, repeatedly, that you will find time to meet with them, was crucial. I did so sometimes during the weekends, sometimes late after dinner, and I would occasionally find them in small Zoom groups trying to understand the material or wrestling with a mathematical proof that I assigned in class. Those extra interactions where each person was connecting from their own room, made a big difference, and were greatly appreciated.This experience has been singularly exhausting.   Everything is more work, and everything takes more time, with considerably less personal satisfaction in the job, and less effective results.I miss seeing my students and the good-natured banter that accompanied Q&A sessions.  I did receive, though, a number of very positive comments after the course ended from students who wanted to offer thanks for how I handled things.  I'll be teaching totally online in summer.  I'm pretty confident now about the main class, but pretty antsy about the labs that students will be doing at home.By the way, I'll retire at the end of summer, and this is for me a weird way to end an almost 40-year career.I think, a transition to on-line education would have happened even without a pandemics: the time was ripe.My prediction is that on-line education will continue on a much higher level than before the pandemics.The most useful advice I found was to not treat transitioning to online teaching like designing an online class from scratch. My goal was to replicate the interactions and assessments that happened face to face as well as possible. That helped me get off the ground quickly in planning and communicating my plans to students. I also had the benefit of one class period in person before we went online when I knew the switch was happening, which let me do a test run of Zoom with my students physically in the room, and I think that was very helpful for them.When I first learned about the possibility of going online, I googled best practices for online teaching in general and Physics in particular. I decided to make short lecture and example problem videos that my students could watch asynchronously. For synchronous discussion we used Zoom. On a typical day I would post some discussion questions to be answered via the polling feature, which would often lead to a good discussion, then I would put students into \"Breakout Rooms\" and they would either work on a problem or on a computational project. It worked quite well. Homework was from the book, assigned every class day and due the next class day - but I was much more flexible with late work than I usually am.The course I took online was a second year math and computational methods course for physics majors. It combines traditional mathematics instruction (lectures, discussion sections, written weekly homework) with complementary scientific programming in Python (two intro interactive lectures, weekly Jupyter homework). The programmatic part was already provided through a course JupyterHub server and we already used Piazza for class discussion and a simple HTML website which I maintained for assignments, lecture notes, etc. The only things we did to go online were: 1. Switch to Zoom lectures (recorded for those in different time zones) in which I asked students to either interrupt or use the group chat to ask questions/discuss and did 1-2 simple zoom polls per lecture.2. Have homework submitted as scanned PDFs (we encouraged students to use camscanner or equivalent) to a Dropbox file request link. We marked up these PDFs with iPads to grade them and emailed them back out.This worked fine.The biggest problems:1. Going to essentially untimed take home exams (24 or 48 hours) to accommodate multiple time zones meant that I had to write them to be hard to use the internet for cheating. This made them hard exams but mostly seems to have worked. Of course, we can't guarantee that students didn't get help but that's essentially impossible.2. Peer-to-peer learning (eg. through working on homework together in the undergrad physics lounge, etc) is essentially lost.Transition was somewhat easy since taught small (14 students) upper-level class attended mostly by physics majors and physics graduate students.Online teaching is a very poor substitute for face-to-face contact.  Education cannot be mass roduced, particularly at the upper levels of physics.  We do online because we have to, not because it makes eduational sense.I didn't like the transition. It was very difficult to tell if the students were engaged.Interestingly enough, students hated online classes - not just the physics classes, all online classes. They especially disliked asynchronous classes. It is hard to give short quizzes or exams online - not all but some students just copied from the web or tried to pay for someone to solve their exams.o depending on content lectures were either pre-recorded and posted on a University server or conducted as a video conference using Zoom if interaction was needed. While I have a lot of positive experience with doing research using video conferences it seems challenging to get good class participation in a video conference. Lot's of responses and questions in the chat window but few speak up. o However, in the so-called weekly writing labs my TAs succeeded to get very active participation. Key seemed to be setting up break out rooms with small groups working on small in class projects.All in all it went as well as I could have hoped and certainly much better than I feared. I am very curious to see the student evaluations.The transition was smooth. I happened to be teaching the two courses I have taught online in the summer for several years so I had most of the material I needed already prepared. Some adaptation of it was required, but not much. On the surface, student assessed performance did not change in any obvious way. I do worry about things that are not easily tangible that do not get communicated well online and the lab experience is not nearly as rich. This is true both for the COVID influence semester and the previous summer classes I have taught.Feedback from students, and their final exam that I just graded, both confirm what we already knew: remote teaching does not and cannot replace face to face teaching:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEmuEWjHr5cI've received multiple teaching and outreach awards in the past, and good teaching has been a lifelong interest. My teaching workload tripled as I tried to provide some semblance of a reasonable education for my students, even though it detracts from my tenure case.I made the new expectations very clear and told my students repeatedly that at all times they should feel they know what is going on in the course.During the two weeks we had to prepare I wanted to make sure that technical glitches would not eat into class time.   (Invariably they did, but were minimized).   Synchronous learning was something that both the class and I wanted-it helped somewhat to preserve the community feel .  However there was much  less peer discussion during Zoom classes.  To facilitate discussion, I would walk away from the meeting for about a minute and I could hear a louder buzz among students. We tried breaking into smaller groups and reconvening but that was clunky so gave up on that.  I like the fact that I could record my class and post it together with the document camera class notes.  But my entire class and I missed the face to face interaction-I could not gauge their understanding, be on the alert for puzzled looks and the feeling of a tight knit community was lost.Since faculty were instructed to teach \"remotely\" with only 1 week to prepare, I developed steps to achieve a full implemented plan by week 3 of the shut-down. Week 0, Developed policy, syllabus changes, and professor contact information. Adjusted calendar of class meetings and learning objectives for those class meetings (adding online responsibilities for students), sent a \"Changes to Course Number XXXX\" notice email to all students. Delivery technology beta testing (camera, laptop choice MAC or PC, bandwidth available at my home provided by Xfinity (Speakeasy speed test), and preparation of lecture materials for audio and video recording. Finally, I prepared 5 class sessions (scanned handouts-PDF, made notes to self to be more demonstrative in my voice delivery so to keep the attention of the students and typical review of lecture material prior to class).  These five classes were \"audio only\" lectures and to be delivered asynchronously. The purpose of the audio lectures was to meet institutional goals (ready to start online/remote delivery by Week 1) and to allow me prepare to add the video component for Week 2.  Week 1, students gained access through D2L and navigated to the News portal. Here they received a Power Point slide package for the day's lesson and my audio lecture. While students were signing on each class period and sending me questions (if any),  Also during Week 1, I was practicing and recording the lessons for analysis and mastering (what I could) a live delivery system, sharing PowerPoints, simulations, and videos for Week 2 delivery. AT this time, I made changes to my office at home and made a \"educational video studio\". The area needed to be a quiet place away from pets and people, neutral background, and comfortable because this is my classroom for the two months averaging 3 three classes a day. (Don't forget to have your coffee/water/etc. available.) After a few tries, I was feeling confident using Zoom and sharing other video components and ready to go live during Week 2. Week 2 had its challenges (not all students could do synchronous, students did not have handouts/observation lab sheets available, students needed \"handholding\", others were not engaged. During this time,  I performed many hours outside of class dealing with student's inability to manage the technology (connection speed, can't locate the lesson/lab, or simply not attending class). I went on a recruiting campaign to ask those, who were not attending, to return to class. Prior to my request, I only had 50% attending, after the request, 80%. By the end of the semester, 88% were attending, remaining students dropped the course. Week 3, the course dynamics smoothed and the delivery felt more face to face. The students were familiar with the  delivery system and were learning. I did notice a drop in median test scores from face-to-face delivery to online lecture/testing of +/- 10%,  (median= 82% to 75%) across all sections. I conclude this to be a case \"online student fatigue\" with those students taking more than one online course as opposed to students taking just one. I continued the Week 2 approach through the final week of the course meetings. I recently completed the semester and happy to decompress. I am sure I will reflect on this time and discover other revelations as my recollections become clearer.You said 5-7 minutes, and I've spent that already. Sorry!Enough of my students had issues at home or were homeless so I changed my instruction to be as equitable as possible and allow them the greatest chance of success. Knowing enough about their lives was essential to my choice of human care over just plain learning the info. I lowered my content goals and don’t mind at all. In addition, I moved from a participation mindset (group work, upper division tutorials, social learning, research based tools) to one of proficiency (but with repeated attempts at solving problems, revisions on exams, etc). The point was to help them eventually arrive at the right place and to help them get there. But half my class never turned in a thing except for the exam and final, meaning no hw, because of other life circumstances (no WiFi at home, no space to work in the trailer, no home, job requirements, depression, quarantine, etc.).Online instruction is a complete failure.Sharing experiences, ideas, discussions on faculty list-serve email became hugely active and useful. All levels participated and across whole university.Prep-time is extremely long compared to in person teaching.Students preferred asynchronous modules built around mini lectures. But very time consuming to make.Used Live class presentations for end of term project. Worked so well that I would use much more in future. Pressure to produce “clean” takes is tough. Every mis-step is going to be watched over and over. I have been teaching a flipped course for several years, so the switch to online had no impact as far as the preparatory videos, learning checks, and homework. In class meetings students work in groups and, when in person, undergraduate assistants and I move from group to group to discuss the material.  We had to emulate the latter using Zoom breakout sessions.  The limitations of the system meant that I functioned as a traffic cop, steering assistants to individual group breakout rooms.  I was no longer able to devote any time to answering questions myself.  We ran a new separate section for students in an Asian time zone.  Fortunately, one of our assistants was also in such a time zone.  Providing a secure exam was a challenge.  I wound up using Qualtrics, with multiple choice questions delivered to students in random order and not allowing students to go back to a previous question. Extra problems were added to make up for the student not being able to go back, (which was bad on its own and also meant students had to worry more about time management). Students taking the exam were simultaneously logged onto a Zoom session with their mics on (but not video- too intrusive).I eased the edge off the course by offering lots of extra credit. The students seemed to really appreciate it.In face-to-face instruction, I used many active learning techniques explored by physics education research (PER). E.g., flipped classroom (in the style of Just-In-Time Teaching), Perusall textbook readings, tutorials and group problems during class time. Some of these were unaltered by the switch to online instruction (e.g., Perusall, flipped classroom). Some I continued using, but without the face-to-face contact it was less clear how well they worked (e.g., tutorials, in-class practice problems).lab portion was completely absent.  No way to do in person instruction-no way to substitute.  Physics of musicwhich relied heavily on ensemble playing/experience.I was co-teaching a first-year seminar with an Art History professor.  Getting first-year students to engage in discussion on \"scary\" topics like physics and art was difficult face-to-face, but nearly impossible via Zoom.I was teaching a 'flipped' 'active learning' introductory physics class aimed at our biology majors. This class has zero lectures and spends class time involved in group work and full class discussions. We switched to online and kept our usual activities within Zoom breakout rooms and whole class Zoom discussions. We modified our instructor/LA interaction protocols and our group sizes. Overall we tried to maintain our usual interactive class structure. Our attendance was nearly full. Participation rate in class was harder to judge. But our final exam results and scores were disappointing: low scores, wide distribution and lack of score correlation with prior scores for the same students in the semester. Overall we were left with broad concerns about how effectively students learned after they left campus. We were also concerned if our final assigned letter grades were meaningful given the circumstances. There was also evidence of substantial cheating on the online administered exams, though very hard to judge the scope.Because I had a small class which was already discussion based, the transition was fairly smooth.  My students already had a GroupMe for the class and I encouraged them to use it (more than I normally would).  A few things I tried didn't work as well as I liked - they involved modifying a plan because of lack of equipment.  Other modifications, such as doing some peer evaluation, worked well and I will include in the future regardless of meeting structure.Side note:  I was also heavily involved with the transition of our Introductory courses (both sequences) but have not commented on that in this survey since you were specifically asking about what I taught not what I transitioned.It was horrible, spent way too much time trying to prevent cheating on exams, changing assignments to be multiple guess while programming them into blackboard, and answering emails. Cheating: every method I have seen to prevent online cheating of exams, can be bypassed by a creative mind.Multiple choice: I believe, takes away from critical thinking skills, when learning new material.Excess emails: mostly due to either students not being able to get a face-to-face answer, students thinking I am a mind reader, and multiple emails have to be sent, since students do not send the information needed to answer their question.It went very well and the students seemed mostly happy.  There were definitely things I learned that I would do differently, but considering we were thrown into it unexpectedly in the middle of the term, it went extremely well.The biggest problem was the online exam.  I caught about 130 students cheating online using Discord during our exam (we prohibited collaboration for the short answer part of the exam which was worth 40 of 100 points - the rest of the exam the students were allowed to collaborate on).I considered using respondus, but we were not allowed to require that students have webcams, and without recording students, respondus is too easy to get around (just google \"how to cheat with respondus\").  For the Fall, we are again going with online instruction.  For an introductory physics course, I have no idea how to produce an exam which can accurately asses student performance due to the ease of cheating online, unless I were to spend an inordinate amount of time at it.The only hurdle I faced was dealing with labs. The other components of my course I continued as is. I had already had pre-recorded prelectures and prelecture quizzes that students completed. This continued. For lecture I continued as normal, but delivered via zoom. I used zoom breakout rooms to allow students to discuss think-pair-share questions and complete group work. Students voted via the zoom vote tool.Initially I emailed students tests and required them to write down their answers and include all calculations and then scan the tests and return to me (I always give partial credit for problem solutions).I soon discovered that this method is not feasible due to rampant cheating.  Apparently solved problems from virtually all recent textbooks are available online! In my next online course, I will use Blackboard timed multiple choice qustions to (hopefully) reduce cheating.I suspected a transition would occur. I and my colleagues in the research group therefore started looking at different ways to deliver lectures and give tests on-line about 3 weeks in advance. We had a strategy  a week before the announcement.  Then it was just to implement this.I primarily recorded and posted lectures for the students to watch.  They were required to post a question after each lecture to the discussion board, and there were often attached short assignments that went along w/ each lecture.  Students also had online HW each week as well as an online lab.  While I think this worked OK, I miss the student interaction of a face-to-face class as well as the ability to judge when the students are confused and need additional instruction.  I also don't feel they got as much from the simulation labs as they would from a true hands-on lab.I was already using peer instruction with iclicker cloud software in face-to-face lectures. Before the transition, I was following the news closely and asked my students what format they would prefer if face-to-face meetings were not possible. They thought I was joking, but then our state's stay at home order came just a few days afterward. My preference was asynchronous Khan Academy-style lectures so that students with less internet bandwidth could still participate without missing anything, but I had enough people who wanted synchronous lectures that I found a middle ground. I record a 15-minute mini-lecture and post it for students to watch asynchronously, then we meet synchronously for about half the time we did before, where we still do the peer instruction with iclicker cloud software. Learning Zoom was a little stressful, but once I got it figured out I don't mind it so much. Feedback from students has been very positive. We finished one semester that way, and we're about 25% through our \"spring\" semester, which will be remote from start to finish.Testing is problematic in a large class.  I have no way to proctor that many online students.  Cheating is rampant.  Also, I teach astronomy; labs are difficult online.  There are also no options for real-time observations with telescopes online.  You cannot recreate the experience of being under the night sky.lack of prep time for he transition made it extra hard to transit from F2F to onlone.I think that 5-10% of students at my university could do well with online learning.  The rest do not have the self discipline to learn physics by online courses.  My fellow faculty and I saw class attendance of online lectures drop by 75% after transition to online learning.  Also, about 35-50% of students simply stopped turning in assignments or taking tests.  It seems that without someone to hold their hands in-person through the process of learning, the majority of students at my school flounder.  This was true both in the introductory physics courses as well as the upper level undergrad physics courses.  Maybe it's different at R1 schools, but we were an R3 school reclassified as an R2 in 2018, so our student body may be different.  As an aside, I was very worried that my transition of my upper level E&M class to online learning this spring was horribly ineffective.  At the end of the semester I asked my students to fill out a COVID-19 response survey for extra credit.  Their responses indicated that my online course transition was among the best they had at the university.  I don't know whether to be pleased about this or worried again.Because I regularly teach large classes, two sections of a class with between 150 and 300 students, I have used online and digital tools for many years. The main transition this semester was the creation of recorded video lectures as asynchronous replacements of, or supplements to, the synchronous classes that continued to be held. Planning, scripting, recording, re-recording when I messed things up, organizing, and posting with embedded questions of the videos resulted in something like doubling or tripling of the prep time for lectures.Quizzes and tests were also difficult. Although I tried to do some things to reduce cheating, all of the questions on the tests ended up on Chegg. Because of the emergency nature of this past semester, I did not do a lot to pursue this academic misconduct.My style of teaching lends itself to on-line classes. My serious complaint is that Canvas and Zoom keep changing. Using them is like shooting at a moving target.Prior to COVID-19, I was using a flipped classroom format for instruction in my face-to-face classes. The technology tools provided through the university (Zoom) has facilitated an easy transition to remote synchronous learning. The key features include the breakout rooms and built in screen sharing and whiteboard functions (with an appropriate drawing device). In my case, I open the zoom meeting on my laptop, which is where I control such things as participants and breakout rooms. I also join the meeting on an iPad, which combined with a high quality stylus, makes whiteboard work a breeze.My experience has been that the transition from face-to-face to remote synchronous instruction has been pretty seamless. Furthermore, up to this point in our current semester, student engagement and performance is comparable to face-to-face classes.The biggest concerns we have in our department are (1) how to incorporate laboratory type activities, and (2) the loss of the peer support structure among upper division majors (our department has a dedicated majors room where a lot of collaboration on coursework and positive socializing takes place).I started using a graphics tablet/computer projector for lectures about 5 years ago, after a knee injury, and found that the students can see it better, and the lecture notes can be saved for students with 'note-taking' accommodations.  Transitioning it to Zoom is just a \"screen share\". I typically have 3-5 research Zoom meetings per week for the past several years, so it's familiar territory. The upper-level physics courses I mostly teach have a strong component of homework, and last Fall I put in a lot of work generating new homework problems for the main course I teach. I plan on, but haven't yet, done any online exams.I was lucky as I had a small (11) class size. I was familiar with zoom which I use for research related matters, so transition was not difficult. Certainly nervous about doing this for a large class.There was too much advice to choose from (I consulted, once, an enormous Twitter group with faculty from all over the world, with thousands of incompatible suggestions).  I also had a great deal of trouble getting technical questions answered (no help at all with problems with Apple, TopHat, my textbook publisher, Zoom, or YouTube).  My at-home technical equipment was minimal and out of date (I did almost all my work from the office) but I was one of the fortunate few faculty authorized to come into the office for my Zoom sessions.  Talking to other users was by far the most effective form of help.  I finally settled on a simple but unsatisfactory method of writing out lecture notes and screen-sharing them as I lectured during my synchronous classes, and posting them afterwards.  Breaks for TopHat quizzes or to ask for questions produced almost no interaction, though almost all my class of 29 did join each session.  I converted my exams to take-home (never having done that in 40 years of teaching; that was an unfortunate learning experience as well).  The whole experience was profoundly disheartening, ineffective, and resented by my students.  My own incompetence contributed; I had virtually no prior experience with consumer electronics or social media at any level, and the students found that to be contemptible.   Whatever success I have had in my teaching career was entirely based on circumstances no longer in effect on line.  I took the opportunity to retire this July 1, partly to avoid teaching online in the fall.  (Though I might have retired then anyway, any wavering was eliminated by the prospect of an entire semester like the last few weeks).My class was a 2nd semester calculus-based class.  I believe the most important unit for physics and engineering majors in this course is the relationship between electric potential and field, and we completed that before spring break during in-person instruction.  We then did magnetic fields and electromagnetic radiation online.  Our instruction in those topics has always been descriptive and not mathematically rigorous, so I could put together some asynchronous interactive activities based on PhET, Mastering Physics assignments, and Khan Academy videos and feel good about it.  But I would do things quite differently if I go entirely online this fall.I mostly just moved my pre-planned lectures from the chalkboard to Zoom, using a digital whiteboard on an iPad in place of the chalkboard.  Overall the method seemed to work, but the students had more trouble keeping up with the pace than they did in the classroom.  They suggested that providing notes afterward would help relieve the burden of writing notes and listening remotely.  I also noticed that they were less willing to interact over Zoom than in-person, and generally preferred to use the chat window rather than to speak out loud.My colleagues were emphatic on posting online CSEM and FMCE tests. They did CSEM and the Hake gain they reported was twice as usual. I ended up doing FMCE online (due to politics). However, I still strongly oppose the use of FMCE in Spring 2020 as an indicator of anything.at first I went into a asynchronous class mostly because I also had to do childcare. after two weeks I polled my students and learned they really wanted to meet live so, for the last 4 weeks we met synchronously but it was recorded for those that could not make it.I transitioned to doing weekly online quizzes to give students frequent feedback.Overall, it was  good experience.It went surprisingly well.  I had to drop a few hands on lab type activities, and I substituted some computer based simulation activities for some labs and demonstrations.  I did have planned a field trip to a nearby NASA center which just had to be cancelled.  But everything else transitioned fairly well, including watching a movie, doing reading discussions, guest speakers, and timed and untimed tests.I'm not sure this survey is capturing what I'm trying to tell it. I have been teaching online (fully) for years prior to the Pandemic, so for me it was business as usual as a result. I suffered no headaches, and probably got more students for future courses out of it, as well as an increased preference among students and the dean for being able to meet these changing needs quickly and ably.I learned enough \"on the fly\" to realize that I can do better with more preparation, and that iswhat I am doing this summer.In ability to do hands-on work and difficulty with collaborative (peer-instruction) activities definitely degraded the quality of my class.Feedback is harder to gauge. Absenteeism is a bigger problem, since I refuse to take attendance or water down the class to students who are taking the course because they have to, as opposed to wanting to.Starting Monday, March 16,  all instruction moved to an online format. We had three days to transition to online instructions. I am one of the chalk-board types but learning new things wasn’t so difficult.  I used a web camera with Blackboard. I write on my paper pad and students could see that on their computers. After the first lecture, one student told me that he felt as if  he was  “sitting next  to you and watching you write on your pad”. There were more questions in this format than in the face-to-face instruction. I was also able to di some demos in realtime and at least they were able too see the results on a screen, again with the help of a camera. The closest \"online teaching” (felt like that)  I had done was lecturing to 360 students in UPII in a huge auditorium. I think overall it went well. I missed seeing student faces though, which provide valuable feedback on how well the lecture was going. The labs were the real loss. Cant make holograms or do polarization or spatial filtering online. We had to convert the remaining three (fun) labs to just reports.I used a Kahn Academy style lecture style using \"Explain Everything\" (and Ipad whiteboard app). I pre-recoded the lectures, and played them synchronously during lecture time, allowing for questions and interruptions. I later uploaded the lecture to Blackboard. I found this very efficient, time-wise, and I was able to cover more material in less time. Preparing the lectures took longer, though, since they had to be \"perfect\".our university required that our classes meet synchronously ; remote, but not \"fully on-line\"The worst aspect was the rampant cheating (classmates & Google & Chegg) by some students.it is an upper level phys course, a hands-on experimental modern physics course.  in general a hands-on experimental lab is near impossible to teach online when you're talking about advanced experiments like cosmic ray muons, nmr, chaotic pendulums, optical tweezers, etc.Virtual instruction is challenging for both the teacher and the student, for many reasons. I tried to change as little as possible, by keeping the syllabus and the meeting time for the virtual classes. Now, I am working towards designing a virtual environment that will be more interactive.1. I was already using Canvas and Poll Everywhere, so online course management was not new to me (but no less time consuming).2. Miraculously, when I had taught this course previously, I recorded the lectures using a classroom lecture capture system.  I was able to use these videos rather than making new ones, although I still had live Zoom meetings in which I did new examples.  I uploaded the videos to Panopto and integrated the Poll Everywhere questions so that the video paused for students to vote just like they were in the classroom.3.  The labs were the most difficult adjustment.  We had zero videos ahead of time, so I frantically tried to make recordings of our apparati before classes resumed.  Learning Adobe Premiere Pro was a lot of work, and dealing with large files was difficult to do from home. 4.  I discovered that there still are not enough online physics simulations, and the ones that do exist do not use the same approach as me.  I guess I need to learn how to make interactive simulations on the web.I held live lectures on YouTube at the usual class times, utilizing OBS to set up the streams. Students were present in Discord and could ask questions live, either in the text channel or voice channel. Physics labs were converted to a purely digital format. I used PhET and The Physics Aviary, choosing labs that let students take \"measurements.\" I also utilized a few BU simulations for introducing concepts at the beginning of lab activities. Students completed their lab notebooks digitally and submitted lab reports as usual. Feedback was very positive.As a part time staff I have been given no assistance or guidelines in updating a class developed 10 yrs ago. I have a required teacher of record who has never taught these classes or has online experience. It has been trial and error to the detriment of some student every semester. It is not that bad since I have also been working on a MS in Secondary Education in parallel to teaching.When the technology works, everything seems to be fine with the usual anxiety of the process.When 10% or more of the technology components start failing just before or in the middle of class, anxiety skyrockets and delivery just plummets in quality by about 50%. Smaller passing glitches in technology (pause of internet connection, echo in zoom, strange voices in the background) may increase blood pressure and adrenaline, but after they recover one can continue.It was ok this spring because the students knew each other and I knew them (same students in both the fall and spring).  I teach the class SCALE-UP style, with a lot of in-class group work.  I don't know how it will go next year if we are still remote.  I push hard on community building - they want to get to know each other and make friends, but they are really afraid of doing so.Because of the abruptness of the transition, I think the experience is probably not representative...but I hated it. I’m a professor because I love working with people to help them learn. I’ve spent literally decades Turning my classrooms into places that are hands-on, interactive, collaborative laboratories for exploring the content. I felt I had to throw all of that away because there was no time to think creatively about how to have that same dynamic online. Maybe I can do better by the end of August, but with four distinct classes to prepare, I’m not very optimistic. That’s depressing.Live sessions are extra awkward for me because I am used to face-to-face lectures where I am constantly engaging the students in discussions and having them work with partners, etc. Live Zoom lectures do not seem to produce any of that. If I choose to do more live Zoom lectures, I will definitely incorporate in-class polling, breakout rooms, encourage students to join with video, etc.I followed the Khan format and recorded notes.  My students said that they liked the content I was producing.  I think supplementing the face-to-face with online content will be the way I teach going forward.  It is the closest I have found to a successful model of flipping the class without losing content.I offered my lecture content as pre-recorded videos. The video was a recording of my writing on an iPad screen while talking over it. I then used class time to essentially do office hours answering questions about homework. Homework came in the form of MasteringPhysics (something we had been using all semester); pdfs with problems to be solved, digitized, and uploaded; and lab reports which were uploaded to Canvas. The lab content consisted of recordings of a professor performing the experiment and providing the appropriate data and observations. The exam was provided through the Canvas site as a pdf which the students had 2 hours to solve and upload.Doc cam was essential but I didn't have it immediately. Synchronous participation fell sharply off during the online transition.The online class was simply not to the same standard as face-to-face. The active learning techniques used in my face-to-face classes translated poorly or not at all to online implementation.The biggest problem I faced was being able to give meaningful assessments.  We had a significant problem with a variety of forms of cheating on examinations.I split up my in person lecture which was a combination of peer instruction, in class problem solving, and face to face lecture.  I recorded the lecture portion for asynchronous viewing and used the synchronous class meetings for problem solving and peer instruction.  It wasn't a great solution.  Lots of kinks to work out.  My math methods course was all synchronous as usual.  It was more difficult to deliver effectively online due to all the derivations and increased interaction with majors.  I was not a fan of moving either class online, but we did what we had to do.It was easier than I expected for a basic lecture class with homework and exams. The big problem is labs.Having a bad hand writing makes online teaching with short notice more difficultI have never taught online before the transition of my institution to the online teaching. It was a challenge for me. However, I suddenly discovered a number of tools to teach online. I utilized just few of them (mainly Zoom), but I would like to have more practice and more experience with those tools. I think, it is very useful to run a series of webinars focused on the tools for online teaching. For example, a majority of my colleagues are familiar with Zoom or Skype only. I and they did have challenges with homework assignments and with any tools to replace a blackboard in a classroom.I have been instructional faculty at my institution for 21 years and coordinator of this introductory sequence for 20. I also support our LCMS, LON-CAPA, for the department. During the transition because of the role both as a lead instructor and as technology support for the department, I really didn't have time to research a bunch of ideas. The way forward for short-term coverage was clear, and it took all our time to implement it. With summer going online, I had about 5 days in the end (after collapsing from the previous ordeal) to pull together the current, condensed format (14 weeks in 7) online class. To boot, one week ago I received my non-renewal (ie., one year notice) for my instructional position due to budgetary issues that existed before Covid, but were exacerbated by it. Not a happy time.I had 6 advanced graduate students.  We moved lecture to Zoom and I continued to hold office hours, but moved them to Zoom.  Everything else, including oral reports, was the same.  I used the honor system for the closed-book portion of the exam and I don't think anyone cheated.  I was very lucky to have this class this semester.  It was easy.  Also, I had practice, as I taught in this mode last Fall due to recovery from surgery.I was much slower online and found I repeated myself more. I believe this is because it was harder to gauge how well everyone understood, where as I can tell from facial expressions/physical cues when face to face. I also made the mistake of not initially requiring students to participate with cameras on.The lab portion of the class was changed to be more like thought experiments and reasoning about the physics and was conducted via zoom using breakout rooms.  The most challenging aspect of the class was conducting exams that were fair, not prone to cheating, and not overly burdensome with anti-cheating measures.I typed up my lecture notes and made them available ahead of time, then talked through them over Zoom during the normal class time. Some derivations I worked out on paper while showing them using a document camera.For the Spring I continued teaching synchronous lessons and posting notes, but no recordings. I had issues with the recording software during live lectures and trying to record lectures to post. Very frustrating and time-consuming. I don't have any training for methodology or with the software/hardware associated with video recording and editing. I have used simulations for some labs but they are not adequate for every physics lab, students need hands-on training with equipment and face-to-face time with instructors. Lecture notes do not substitute for live lectures and problem-solving sessions. The few times I've tried to record videos the files become large and cumbersome or there is some glitch, not to mention I do not have  a soundproofed, interuption-free place to make decent quality recordings. I also do not like having my students watch outside videos that do not emphasize the same problem-solving strategies and steps. And don't even get me started about online non-proctored exams or plagiarism.Teaching in the STEM area is difficult because of the lab component and making sure the students are engaged in the learning process.  The hands-on experience with labs is extremely important to students.I teach for the University of Nevada graduate program in atmospheric sciences (not physics per se).  There were 8 enrolled in this graduate-level class in cloud physics, and all were asked via email whether they preferred a zoom class at the appointed time or would rather receive audio files of the lectures during the week that allowed them to listen anytime during the week when it was most convenient for them.  All but one student chose the latter option, so we did it that way.  Regular homework was assigned.The class was on aerosol and cloud physics with the first half on aerosol physics, the 2nd half on cloud physics.  I taught the 2nd half on cloud physics that began at the beginning of lockdown.My class was not a very common model, being a research methods class that involves a lot of student writing, revision and resubmission, as well as presentations and some library research. the students fortunately had completed their second inquiry. their third inquiry became an online survey project, and their final inquiry had to either be an enhancement of their second inquiry, or something using publically available data since we were spread out by the completion of inquiry 2. some students had the equipment they needed at home for that inquiry already.It was a disaster, the support form the institution was minimal and irrelevant.  I have learned a lot about doing online.  I don't see how it is possible to do assessment in any meaningful way with an online course. Instead I think the right model is the freely available MOOC, break the material up into small segments and gave exercises or interactive problems between the segments.  The student can only proceed when they have mastered that segment, and the only \"grade\" is getting to the end.However that brings into question the way Universities are funded from tuition.  It would be more honest to pay us for what we really do, scholarship and research and have the teaching freetoo much work worrying over technical issues for myself and studentsexam cheating is huge, and there seem to be no viable method to prevent italmost all lab courses are useless if onlinestudents seem much less focused on their classwork when onlineit seems that they really view it as one task after another that are disconnectedElectronic circuit simulation software made the transition remarkably smooth. New introductory material and rewriting of lab descriptions were necessary. However, in the end there was value added to the students who learned in-lab techniques during the first half of the semester, and simulation techniques during the second half.With just a few days to prepare, I don't think this was an ideal time to assess how well we taught online.  If we are online in the fall, we have a lot more time to prepare and my institution is giving us some courses to help us produce the best possible online experience for our students.Zoom proved useful.  I was able, using chat rooms, to divide students in groups and basically follow our interactive, studio-style approach with little modification.  Students were responsive and were willing to participate and talk to each other.  Tests were modified to reduce duration, but I felt I could give more complex problems because they were basically open textbook ones :) .  I was lucky to have a reduced teaching load last semester because of my activities in Faculty Senate (I have a 6 hour reassigned time).  Had I had a full load, things would have been much more daunting.Although online teaching may take more time for preparation at the beginning, after done the preparation, the course will become easier. However, online teaching always leaves me an impression informal, as it is still difficult to ensure the progress of the students truly. Also, the tests and homework sets all become problematic as perceived cheating. Another thing about physics online teaching is that students feel uncomfortable to this learning way.From overall experience, some classes are perfect online (say, programming, skills courses etc) same are ok (like astronomy or any seminar like course) and some suck - any lab based courses, including physics introElectronic resources for testing and assessment of quantitative and computational courses in the sciences are abysmal.I teach in a guided inquiry format with students mostly working on small groups. This was maintained by using Zoom breakout rooms. Evidence to support/refute student thinking was provided via videos of experiments, rather than students performing the experiments themselves. The most frustrating aspect was that normally we have whole class discussions to come to consensus and it was much harder to get significant participation in this online.I think it went okay for the students -- the course evaluations indicated that the students obviously missed campus but that the course itself went well.  Also, the grades (homework, exams etc) stayed hte same or improved from the first half of hte course so there wasnt a major loss of learning.  It was just a lot more stressful for me and took a lot of my time.I am teaching summer school now, and I am trying to implement strategies based on lessons-learned from the Spring.Exams were forced to be open book with huge extra time.Nowhere near as rigorous as normal.Grading was just pass/fail.   Hard to take seriously.My experience with online teaching is having students working in groups is a strong encouragement for students to attend synchronous meetings.Most of my students attended the synchronous classes, even though they did have an option between synchronous and asynchronous.horrible.It is not as effective as teaching in person. Student engagement is a major problem. The University gave only lip-service support to faculty. Mainly, professors were on their own.I was lucky in that I had already prepared some electronics lectures in an online circuit simulator, circuitlab.  There was another instructor who had to catch up a bit.  I wish I had used zoom more but had experience with google meet, OBS, twitch and youtube.  I was also able to share some of the preparations with the other instructor.  We only had to teach 2-3 online classes before spring break.  That also helped.  In addition, I was doing some epidemiological modeling for the state department of health and welfare. That was a bit of a distraction and stressors but kept me busy enough to not worry too much about other things going on.Teaching Introductory Physics online is highly NOT recommended. I spent 3 times more time on Webex then face-to-face to help them understand Lenz Law, or the right-hand-rule, or the Brewster angle polarization... just to name a few basic concepts. The impossibility to do think-pair-share, peer-to-peer instruction, and many other student engaging techniques made my class more of a traditional teaching style, which I dislike because it's inefficient. Interactive engagement is imperative to Physics teaching. Over Webex sessions, I could tell that some students had other \"occupations\" and they were not paying attention to class. Others signed in but were not \"really attending\". Other did not attend at all. E.g. one student dropped from A-student from before COVID19 to C-student level in just 5 weeks. The amount of EXTRA time I had to put in (besides 6 hr. contact class time and 2 hr. study session weekly) to get the students at the same level was beyond expectations. towards the end I started keeping score: in the last 3 weeks of class I spent extra time as follows, week#12: 12 hr 20 min; week#13: 3 hrs; week#14: 11 hr.  The number of emails I answered and the number of GroupMe text messages I relied to to keep the students engaged and focused are not included above, but they were another burden of the unfortunate Physics online teaching. Not to mention that cheating can't be controlled. With online teaching I cannot guarantee the quality of my assessment. Even with Lockdown Browser and Respondus proctoring system, some grades were a higher then expected... but that's what it is.The format of my class was studio physics, which means that A.)  the students spend most of their time lecture days working problems in groups, and B.) those same groups would do the labs that were integrated with the course material.  The shutdown came during spring break, which meant I had about three days to figure out the remainder of the five weeks left in the semester.  The work in groups I used the Zoom breakout rooms to put students together for group work on shared whiteboards.  I wrote online simulation based labs to make up for the ones that we would have done in person, and allowed students the option of submitting their lab reports themselves, but also meeting at the normal class time (I estimated about 1/4 of students attended the videoconference for the labs).  Tests were submitted online, and I chose not to use strict proctoring like Honorlock.  Grade results for the remaining exams were not very different from previous in class semesters, so if there was cheating, it was fairly ineffective.  Exams were submitted and then marked up using Canvas' annotate feedback tool.Overall, except for the students who for some reasons simply never attended class again and did not drop/withdraw, the whole experience worked \"enough\".  Not something I would choose to do, and somehow more work, but even those students I was most worried about (including those with accommodations) seemed to finish out okay.We are on the quarter system, so the biggest challenge was to be thrown into this suddenly from the design perspective up. In addition, I was sick with COVID19 in the interquarter break, so it took me a couple of weeks to even get to a level bearing. I feel I have lost a lot of contact with students, it's harder to support students who are struggling, I have to continually experiment as I find the tools do not do what I expect them to, the level of cheating is very high, and there is simply not enough time to deal with all the issues that are happening. On the other hand, students are making use of the resources, there are new opportunities to provide support during exams, and for some students this has turned out to be a better format for self-paced learning.As a graduate student, I wasn't particularly involved in the transition to online teaching midway through the spring semester, so I don't know too much of what the faculty were up to.  I did end up scanning a lot of documents to PDF for one of the classes where I was a teaching assistant, and set up a Discord channel for the students of the class.  I'm not sure the professor did much for that one, beyond providing the scanned notes.  he other class I was TA for during the spring transitioned to online using blackboard and pre-recorded lectures.  The homework changed to blackboard assignments/quizzes, and the labs were moved online by way of providing the students with video and photographs of the experimental apparatus in use, so they could make their own measurements.  From what I heard it didn't always go well, and some students struggled working on their own.  This summer, I am teaching one of the introductory physics lecture courses.  The class is completely online.  I'm using Zoom to do lectures at the normal time the class would meet if it were still done in a classroom on campus, and use the screen sharing features to use an art program as a virtual whiteboard (I have a tablet, so writing is quite easy this way).  I record my lectures and post them online in case a student misses a lecture, although I do still expect them to attend them live whenever possible.  For the homework, since the overall summer class enrollment is relatively small, the students are working assigned problems by hand and uploading the scanned work to Blackboard to turn it in.  The tools available to me for grading work handed in in this manner are less than ideal, but I do prefer the approach of handling things as much like an in person class as possible.  I administered the first exam (the class is still ongoing) as a test in Blackboard, with most questions as essay questions so the students could show their work by typing it in.  This did not go over as well, so I will probably explore ways for the students to just provide their own handwritten work going forward.  I think the labs for the summer courses are following the style from the end of last semester.  The lab coordinator takes pictures and video of all relevant measurements and the students are expected to use them to sort of do the lab on their own.  Labs have three Zoom sessions a week where the lab instructors can speak with the students and help them with any questions.  We have encountered some issues with the photos and other information for lab (provided in a folder on google drive) not being organized well, and are working on improving it.  An unusual issue we encountered for lab is that the lab coordinator used a color coding system for the masses added to a hanger in one experiment, so students would need to \"read\" the total mass based on colored tape on each mass.  One student is colorblind, so that method had to be abandoned.Since this semester I had decided to prepare my in person classes in Power Point, delivering them on a Tablet with a stylus which allowed for handwriting during a Power Point delivery, the transition to on-line was pretty straightforward regarding the content. However, not being able to see the students' faces during the lectures was a big minus and, while the students still were able to ask questions, I've noticed that their participation on line was less than in face to face classes.A positive side was that absolutely every student joined the on-line synchronous class, while some students would miss face-to-face classes; but my impression is that it happened because it was a way to find a \"real life\" community during the COVID-19 crisis, i.e., my impression is that this may not be the case for on-line classes in regular times.limping along, improvising, testing is insecureThe assessment in the graduate course I taught Spring 2020 was already project based which turned out to be easy to transition to online. Their presentations on their projects were also easily moved online using Zoom. Collecting, grading, and returning homework was difficult and in the end I eliminated it. Providing flexibility turned out to be very important to the students.I was surprised that at least initially, most of my teaching effort had to go into working with and to the extent possible, assuaging, student anxiety about the overall global situation and our specific course situation.  We spent a week or more after the transition to online talking about expectations and course format in gory detail.  I don't know that I was expecting that, or at least expecting it to that extent, and given that the situation in the fall will be similar (uncertain students being taught by non-expert online teachers) I'd like to be able to plan for it better.I also found it even more difficult when lecturing via recording or Zoom to gauge what students were understanding and what they weren't and left very uncertain how to assay this in an online format.  I usually use informal hand-raise style queries in person and didn't find a great substitute for this kind of on the fly communication in an online lecture.  I've tried PollEverywhere and found it forever clunky and unfriendly and am forever fighting with students being signed in correctly, etc...I was very fortunate that enrollments in my courses were all low (under 20) so I knew the students well and could mostly trust them to take at-home paper tests on the honor system.I had to laugh at your list of technologies I could have used. There was no time even to research what the options were! I desperately needed a personal consultant who could make technology recommendations and answer my questions about what various technologies would and wouldn't do--and my university provided no such consultant. Moreover, I didn't want to impose stringent technical requirements on my students on such short notice. So I just kept things as low-tech as possible, telling students to read their textbook and then type questions in online discussions. I learned that many of them find reading distasteful. They really prefer watching videos!I was fortunate to already be regularly using a significant number of online tools with my face-to-face course. These include my LMS (Blackboard) - including Blackboard Collaborate for \"Online Office Hours\", which I've held in the last evening as an option for students for many, many years). I already use an online homework system in the class (MyOpenMath). I repurposed this system to build the online class into two asynchronous learning modules per week, complete with built-in exercises/assessment. Further, I've personally taken about half a dozen online courses in the past year (all related to instructional design and multimedia design), so I was very well equipped to move my own course online (I am so glad that I took these courses - turned out to be brilliant timing, in hindsight)! Most faculty, however, went into this situation with a lot less training and experience then me...I went fully asynchronous due to timezone and time management issues (including being stuck at home with a kindergartener) and my biggest takeaway was that while that was the most flexible and convenient, I did miss regular synchronous interaction with the students. For the Fall, I plan to continue with significant asynchronous content but also incorporate more synchronous aspects to help maintain a class learning community. My university intends to have some face-to-face class time but my class is based on groupwork/active learning that won't work in a socially-distanced classroom...I don't use Zoom, because I am very shy/embarrassed/uncomfortable with being on camera.I don't want to use AV conferencing technology.I don't want to use any such tech media as a primary means of communication. It is inefficient, frustrating, reduces learning, strains communication, and doubles everyone's workloads.My anxiety through all of this is greatly magnified as I have ASD and GAD.I've also had a similar experience with transition to online labs... many students wrote in their evals that they need to see and get their hands on the equipment to understand it.Online learning works well for too few people to replace live instruction.Go back to meeting in person and make online a \"last resort only\" strategy.FYI, the one online \"class\" that I have previously taught was online astronomy lab. It's just preformatted questionnaires and students can email me with questions.With regard to the 30-minute interview question in this survey, as I explained, I am uncomfortable with being on camera. Perhaps phone or email would work better, but, given my hesitation (rather than willingness) to be contacted for such an interview, I will have to decline entering my email in that field.Since I had a small (10 people) graduate class, and a good rapport with those students, the transition was very easy for me. My students did not have kids so we could meet at our regular class time, but I also recorded lessons in case someone had to miss. I tried to get the same amount of interaction as we had before the transition to online, with virtual office hours, virtual student meet-ups/study-groups, and lots of opportunities to answer questions and ask questions during lessons.My colleagues and I met for coffee most days to talk about what was working and what was not. I know some faculty members struggled, but I honestly think that where there is a will, there is a way to teach in a fun and engaging way.I should note that I extensively used Canvas/Blackboard for my face-to-face classes before the transition to remote learning, so that really prepared me as all my materials were neatly organized already online and I had given out electronic assignments before. For some of my colleagues, this was all new.Because of this lecture online, two benefits arose. 1: Students from other campuses are able to listen.   2: Since Zoom can record my lectures, the nearly entire lectures have become instant volume of video lecture notes. The students and my colleagues can enjoy them.Use of zoom and U-Tube videos!I changed as little as possible. I did live video classes with a virtual whiteboard, with recordings for those who could not attend. Assignments were unchanged except labs were done virtually. Exams were take-home, and about half of the class was reported for academic dishonesty.In general, onliine wasn't as horrible as initially anticipated. Zoom breakout sessions work reasonably well with the ISLE approach I've used predominantly and most activities only needed to be modified slightly, often in the form of videotaping demos and labs. There were of course issues, particularly around time management and adapting labs for a video format. Some worked well enough, others not so much. Also, some students experienced tech problems, as did I from time to time. All that said some students tended to become more involved with the online format. The pros did not outweigh the cons in my mind and I don't particularly look forward to doing this again in the fall, except to say it is looking like the safe thing to do. I don't want to put myself and others at risk for the sake of having them drop a coffee filter rather than make measurements off a video. Mostly what I need to prepare is simply more time, although I also will try to improve on managing the sessions productively and try out ideas around making the labs asynch.The transition was most difficult for my most vulnerable students (i.e., non-white / non-male students).I really miss the face to face classroom.  You can read people's faces.  I get feedback from them.  They get it from me.  Gestures, facial expressions are way better if I'm not a disembodied head.Speed of responding to emails is key.  Many students complimented on how quickly I was able to respond to their questions.  This shows how much you actually care for the students.Explaining physics through an email is difficult.  Taking the extra time to show the individual mathematical steps made it far easier for the students to understand.The students I have interviewed hate it as do I.   Just too standoffish.  Physics is a how things work endeavor and remote teaching denigrates this experience.   Only about 1/3 students attend the synchronous lecture where we use chat for questions (very few)...so I assume the rest of the class listens to the saved cloud recordings.  Difficult and time consuming to save more than 1MB  or ~ 6 lectures.  I spend ~15 hours more per week teaching this way.  We have developed real on-line physics courses (took 2 years) in the past and the students hate these also.After limited experience with my own and my department colleagues' approaches to online teaching during the spring term, I have an \"emerging belief\" that synchronous meetings, despite concerns about being less flexible and/or equitable, are essential for securing and maintaining student engagement in learning.  I plan to incorporate a substantial synchronous component to any and all future online courses.My two biggest concerns were:1) I was not aware of the large population of students who do not have access to a computer. Many of my students were working from their phones or tablets. In many cases, they had to share one device with other people.2) Many of my students had to take a job to help their families (delivering stuff or at supermarkets). With all this combined, it is impossible to teach synchronous. As instructors, I believe it is crucial to be flexible about these restrictions.I already teach my face-to-face classes using a flipped model, so I already had lots of resources for the students.  The transition for both the students and I was very smooth.I found a tablet+software recreated the blackboard/whiteboard experience well. However, there is a definite lack of good software for this! Students need a bit more encouraging and stimulating during class time to keep focussed. Breaking things up works well.(1)  What your survey does not include is difficulties with technology starting from an old laptop with an old operating system and a shaky internet access even in a rather affluent neighborhood on my end, to students dialing into Blackboard Collaborate from a phone, having spotty internet access, and often no space to work quietly.(2)  Your questions focus very much on modern technology.  Besides slides in PPT, nearly all my lectures were on paper with an old webcam showing everything I derived or example I went through.  Better than any fancy gaget (if I can fix some problems with the autofocus).(3)  The main problem in online teaching is two-fold:  It is much harder to judge students' comprehension even in small-group breakout sessions, and most importantly performing equitable tests. The latter is really the main challenge as I go into summer teaching.online teaching lacks many key aspects of coursework including hands on lab time and and face to face interactions with group work. Online teaching particularly for lab courses is a far cry from in person lab experience and IMHO is not much more than busywork. I have discussed this with other TA's who are similarly frustrated with the unprecedented situation but online teaching is not taken seriously by students on average.We teach in a guided-inquiry style so we simply moved that to Zoom and used Breakout rooms for our groups and popped in and out to help/check-in on each group's progress. We made videos of each of the experiments they would have done in person and provided those via our LMS. We did not have great discussions on Zoom as it was too easy for students to not turn on their video and remain silent. We felt blind as the visual clues we had so relied on were not available via Zoom. Teaching a guided-inquiry style course on-line was do-able but we would need to work hard on getting the same level of interaction that we did in person. Online assessment without cheating was hard. We had a large number of students upload our final exam questions to Chegg which we caught. We hadn't realized that they could get real-time answers to uploaded questions.The biggest challenge was to ensure students' participation and active engagement. This was somewhat of an issue even when teaching face to face; some students sat in the back and did not always pay attention. During remote \"class\" about 20% of students did not log in and it is unknown how many of them were paying attention. Only about 10-20% asked questions. We also had asynchronous discussion/problem solving forums through Canvas, about 50% of students participated regularly in that, and about 10% not at all.I taught an advanced grad class with an enrollment of only 6 students. We transitioned to online only part way through the semester, so expectations for students were very much in place and the transition was not challenging. We used MS Teams, on the recommendation of my institution, to meet synchronously every lecture. I used the files function to upload updated syllabus, general and project information. I used the chat window to get students to answer on the fly questions, making sure they could write an answer down and then all submit simultaneously to reveal answers - a little like clicker questions. Overall, the learning gain through the semester was a little higher than previous face-to-face delivery of the same course. Statistically that might not be significant though given the size of the group.In Michigan the governor announced no closures would be forthcoming; the next week she issued stay at home orders.  The next day our university announced that the following day we would be online.  Last minute changes like that, while fully understandable, made it a nightmare.  I think going forward all faculty should have a backup, fully online lesson plan ready to go.  My greatest concern in all of this, however, is grade inflation and lack of ability to do in person lab exercises.As an aside: online education does not in any way, shape, or form work.  Khan Academy, youtube, etc. are not substitutes for in person instruction.  Anyone who thinks online education is the way of the future doesn't understand what education is and should lose their job.Physics labs are suffering from being online. I think this is the area impacted the most.Working under professor's who really focused on making the best of things made for very smooth transitions. Working under professor's who did not focus on making the best of things made for very rough transitions.Since the transition was abrupt we were not able to get anything from the department so I really missed the demos we usually carry out to explain better. I was able to cobble together some at home ( which I aim to use in in class too). The other thing I missed was ' writing area / board space'.At first I tried to make the class as identical to F2F as possible. That quickly fell apart as I do a lot of in-class collaborative work with the students working in groups of 2 to 3. The other issue is that my students had to struggle with both tech access (both computers and wifi) and time shifts with both work and home pressures. Within a week about a third of my students went asynchronous and just watched the Zoom recordings. I used Canvas extensively to add videos of lecture demos and to provide links to physics applets. In future I would plan to make exams/quizzes that directly tie into these applets. The biggest transition for me was going to all lecture format with only some student feedback via Chat. I tried various polling programs but the tech issues with the students all having different systems was too much of a disruption rather than a help, plus, a third of my students were not live anyway, so polling (sort of \"clicker style\" questions) seemed somewhat pointless. The biggest misery was exams. I'm certain that cheating was prevalent. On the simplest level, the exam averages went from low 70s to upper 80s. I also had to spend extensive time rewriting my exams so that they could not be simply Googled to find complete solutions.It isn't that different from a face-to-face class. I rapidly got used to it. The biggest difference is figuring out how to use digital tools more effectively. Some of my colleagues simply scribbled on paper under a document camera, or filmed themselves in front of a chalkboard---boring. A digital whiteboard allows more options that help keep students engaged...graphics, slides, videos (did not use), highlight pens, etc. Also Zoom polls.Previously I gave closed book exams in a proctored location (testing center).  Now I am giving online, open book exams that the students take at home.  Test scores have risen somewhat, and I wonder whether my class is now sufficiently challenging for my new teaching strategy.The most disappointing aspect is the students' willingness to cheat on exams using access to groups like Chegg, OpenStax and Google.  We were using Turning Technologies for our exam polling software and, due to a huge wave of cheating in 2 classes on the first \"online\" exam, we had to switch to the Canvas LMS system for the Final Exam.  Our results were much more representative of in-class results from years previous, though cheating is still possible.Even with our diligence in preparing exams, our department head was teaching a lower-level, 1-hour course required for physics majors.  In this small course, 75% of the students in the course joined a GroupMe where they shared the same \"wrong\" answers.   (They didn't realize that the answers were randomized!)  The shared results were easy to track in the small class and those students were given an F for the course and put on Academic Probation.  It is interesting that the leader of the cheating was due to graduate in the Spring 2020 and this course is only offered once a year.I was mostly just trying to get content to my students, so I recorded lectures and had zoom help sessions for Q&A.  I have used Learning Catalytics and online homework for several years so I wasn't completely without online experience and tools.My class was an outlier, which is why I did so little work in transitioning. It was a discussion/presentation oriented class, so all the grading was for participation or presenations.  The university transitioned to online teaching after spring break, where only 3 weeks of classes were left. We had 2 guest lecturers and then a series of student presentations, so there was not really much adjustment.I bought an iPad and Apple Pencil which allowed me to share my screen using Webex. The students could then observe me helping them solve physics problems.The transition was an emergency meet be so I improvised ways to take a inquiry type class online. We used videos and I provided data. In the fall we will most likely be taking the class online again. I can’t just ivy the same emergency improvisation in the full fall semester.There are several challenges I have faced in the rapid move to online:1. Getting student feedback in-class 2. Assessment strategies are not well-developed at my institution for distance format3. Lack of tools to do everything we do in-class4. Lack of rapid feedback face-to-face can provideSynchronous activities were a lot harder. Students were less focused, got less out of them. But they did enjoy the new asynchronous media.I enjoy teaching online. I think having student do labs/activities at home help them see and understand physics. I would like to continue teaching online.When we moved online in Spring 2020, I know my students took several classes, therefore, in order to have continuity and discipline, I maintain the same schedule and delivered my lectures the same as for face-to-face classes where I used iClicker student response system and physics demonstration videos.I believe my experience transitioning online was fairly typical.  I had used a number of blended instructional strategies during my face-to-face courses and so those transitioned fairly well.  The biggest issue I faced was that of academic integrity not he part of students.  The amount of cheating I suspected but could not prove took place makes me wonder if my certification of student mastery had much validity after going online.We transitioned over finals week (quarter schedule) and spring break. I shifted my final to a take home and got a very similar grade distribution on it compared to what I expected. I then transitioned into running several studio sections in a larger course. I am not the IOR for this course. That has been a blessing since I have just had to help out as best as I can and not have to worry about it too much myself.I'm happy to be interviewed, but my situation is rather unique so I don't know how useful it would be.I usually use PowerPoint slides, document cameras, black board, and clicker in F2F lecture. When my classes were shifted to online, I used Zoom and shared my lecture slides. I also pointed a paper by web camera and wrote down to solve example problems and extra information replace of using doc camera and black board. Weekly assignments were posted on University Blackboard. Everything worked well except providing exams. Some students cheated on my exams. Entire my final exam problems were posted on Chegg. Some students worked together so that I saw a couple of exams which had exactly same solutions/mistakes with the same exam scores. Of course, my exams were NOT group exam. I had to make my exams harder since that situation. I also made 4 different version of exams that have the same problems but different numbers used and problem order were changed.I feel OK about my own classes. My knowledge of the subject matter saved me from my obvious technological shortcomings. I  think my entire department did a very good job.  What is worrisome to me is that we made decisions based on the \"this is the best we can do\" principle. No one knows how good THAT is on the absolute scale. We will not know. No one is asking the students how they feel about not being able to go to the physics lab or the chemistry or biology lab and  see things come to life and take \"their own\" data, graph it, interpret it, understand it and draw conclusions from it. You should not give me that much room to write. Thanks.People seem to be divided strongly into two camps for synchronous vs. asynchronous interaction with students.  My opinion is strongly on the asynchronous side, at least for lecture materials; I think the traditional lecture format translates very poorly to online/remote learning.For asynchronous teaching, I strongly believe that dividing the material into smaller portions is useful; my lecture materials were recorded in 10-15 minute videos.  At the same time, I believe it is important to have *some* synchronous component, e.g. real-time chat, Zoom office hours, live examples in order to interact with students and give them the opportunity for immediate feedback.  The ability to have direct interaction with students is what can separate standard university remote classes from the MOOC model.For the spring 2020 semester transition to all-online, I did not do some of what I would do for a class that was planned and advertised as an online or partly-online class. For example, the students hadn't signed up for an online class, so I didn't feel comfortable requiring them to have a webcam capability for Zoom conferences and for proctoring online exams. I will require it in the fall for students who want to take exams online instead of in person.I was teaching an honors intro course to about 50 students. I made a number of adaptations: I pre-recorded lectures and did extensive editing to incorporate demonstrations, computer simulations, and video quizzes in place of in-class iclickers. This all took about 8 hours of work per hour of content -- way more time that I was spending on the in-class version of the course, which I had taught multiple times. (I'm chair of my department, and I chose to teach a class that I could teach without a lot of new prep -- boy was I wrong!) Although my institution switched to a Pass/Fail system in which students have an option to \"uncover\" their grades, I changed the default grading rubric to provide the students with many more options (weight pre-covid work higher, submit a project in place of the final exam, or take an exam in place of a project, etc.) I switched written homework and in-class exams to online versions administered through Gradescope. At the beginning, I polled students to ask about their access to technology, their biggest concerns, etc. (Their two biggest concerns were: staying motivated, and integrity of exams. Personal health and safety was far down the list.) I made clear that we would proceed with flexibility, compassion, and generosity. I think it was a success, but I hope it's an experience none of us has to repeat.The teaching itself I think was fine. I do have some concerns regarding the exams, as I suspect students communicated with each other etc.It was a challenge for me to teach online as I never taught online course. Initially I was quite stressed out. But after some online research and having 4-5 days to prepare powerpoints and putting everything in place, my classes went really well. Having a touchscreen laptop was by biggest blessing. I just bought the stylus for my laptop and I was good to go! In fact I believe that my lectures and labs  classes went really well and since I was recording the lectures on zoom, students had an advantage to watch them if they missed the lecture or want to review the topic again.The lesson I learned and was surprised that even through we are in  21st century, where everything is technology based, I was not prepared for online teaching. I feel like it was a slap on my face:) but now I believe that I am ready to teach online and face to face .I kept the format fairly similar. Lots of small group work, with a little bit of whole class discussion. This format was adaptable to remote instruction, and the breakout rooms in Zoom seemed to work fairly well.As an experimental high-energy nuclear physicist, I feel that the challenges of participating in a large international collaboration had prepared me for the transition to online learning. I had already been participating online meetings on an almost daily basis and had already taught advanced graduate classes remotely so that I could spend more time at the laboratory.Though I had little time to get ready for online teaching, I was lucky in teaching a small class. Still, I made a number of mistakes that were hard to fix once made, but will inform my teaching if I have to do it again.My videos were too long, students had no incentive to actually listen, and I had literally 2 days to transition. Big fail by the school.  There was no way we could be ready to go in two days, especially since I had three classes that semester so everything was fly by the seat of the pants.I found that a synchronous lecture using Powerpoint over WebEx allowed me to do almost everything I would have been able to do in my planned class except for student homework presentations, group work, and in-class exams. I had to modify my syllabus to remove the requirement that student teams present a homework problem in class every other week, making the homework grade entirely based on written solutions.  Lectures: I used an iPad to share my screen and annotate my slides to include the content I would have put on the board like example problems and derivations. The prepared slides were a mix of blank slides with titles and slides with content.  The saved slides that I posted for my students included annotations and I also posted the WebEx recordings of the lectures to Canvas for students who lacked reliable internet or were unable to attend synchronously due to time zone differences.  The main aspect of lecture I missed was face-to-face interaction where I could use facial expression and body language cues to gauge student understanding. Also, the students seemed hesitant to ask questions in class when they were being recorded so I offered them the opportunity to ask questions via online survey in advance of the lecture to earn their participation credit.Office Hours: I was also able to project my iPad screen on WebEx during online office hours to \"write on the board\" for students. Students sent me messages/photos via Telegram chat to ask questions about their work, allowing me to see how their solutions were progressing. Course management and grading: I had already used gradescope extensively for paperless submission of homework and grading so that transition was straightforward. I also already used Canvas for online reading quizzes and course management. Exams: The main challenge was ensuring the integrity of exams.  I allowed the students to pick the format of the midterm exams and they chose a 3 day take home exam which was open note and open book. The final was the same format, but with a self-imposed 3 hour time limit.  I am still not sure if they followed the time limit or the requirement not to consult the internet or each other, though I saw no direct evidence of cheating.Student feedback: I offered several opportunities for anonymous feedback during the transition to online. In general, the students reported a positive experience though some reported internet access issues prevented them from fully engaging in the synchronous lectures.  The students who completed the end of semester evaluation gave the course an overall 4.75/5 rating, though they did acknowledge they understood the challenges I faced in converting to online and were likely more lenient than if the course had been planned to be online from the beginning. They also recognized that I was bandwidth-limited since I had an infant and school age kids unexpectedly at home.I was teaching the LA Pedagogy course (Physics Cognition and Pedagogy); I am also director of our LA program, so spent many hours with other LA Program leadership working out how the LA-supported courses would transition to online instruction, and then working with faculty and LAs to practice the various strategies in the two days before spring break + online instruction. The support structure of a group of dedicated colleagues working together was very valuable.I vacillate between this is all not so bad to I may soon choose a different career.So, the main thing that was really hard and that you didn't hit on here was that I was also stuck at home with two small children, so I had a lot of added child care responsibilities. This made any kind of teaching really hard.I already planned on teaching a flipped-classroom and had assigned youTube videos as prep work so my overall strategy didn't need to change much. It took us a little bit to figure out Zoom breakout rooms to facilitate small group work, but we got the hang of it. Everyone got better at showing work using annotate and the whiteboard functionality. The biggest change I made was making the exams collaborative and over multiple days rather than in-class.Parts turned out better than I expected.  Most students have showed up for the group meetings on Zoom, and the work they have turned in appears to be similar to the past.  The greatest loss has been the sense of whether I am adequately communicating.  The second greatest loss is having students experience using the apparatus directly.  I have had to change the focus of the lab away from doing the experiments toward a stronger emphasis on understanding the experiments.Online teaching is great, we should do more of it, syncronous and asyncronous. My students absolutely love it.I strongly appreciated sharing ideas and workload with my colleague who was teaching the same course.By far the biggest challenge was not pedagogical or technological, but psychological: A large fraction of the students taking our calc-based intro physics course seemed to simply check out after the transition to online, either entirely or mostly. Attendance rates at the synchronous Zoom-based lab class we tried (with breakout rooms for lab groups) were horrible. Attendance rates at our asynchronous, drop-in Zoom+Slack help sessions were horrible. Assignment completion rates were bad, and students who did turn work in seemed to be merely going through the steps mechanically, as if looking for easy points and not actually engaging. It's like everyone was in shock.Word of mouth in the department and on campus is that this was a widespread phenomenon, not limited to this intro lab course.Given the speedy transition, me and a team of other 3 faculty members (we were coordinating), made a huge effort to make a \"seamless\" transition to online teaching. The aim being to keep a similar dynamics to the face-to-face teaching. This was somewhat successful. But it is clear to me that this is not the correct strategy. Students learning remotely can't really interact in the same way as we did in our studio classes. Though young students are used to online interactions, they also keep some distance (privacy). So, a future online teaching course (on the Fall), will require some restructuring of the teaching that uses more systematically online tools of interaction. We have employed for example a LON-CAPA platform that gives good real-time feedback on the exercises. That's a good example of how things should work, I think.I had to transcribe my notes and scan them, in order to post them for the students. This requirement took more time than I expected. I also had to substantially modify my presentation slides, as I was not able to actively use a board next to the screen for in-depth analysis. It was not possible to gauge the level of understanding of the audience, since I could not observe them as a group. For graduate classes, video-conferencing is not effective, as most of the lectures are dynamic interactions between the students and me, which was not possible at all without creating an audio chaos.'-Made me aware of the differences (pros/cons) between online and face-to-face teaching. I now feel that the best path forward for my teaching will integrate both forms of instruction- with an expectation that, should one form of instruction fail (maybe a subset of students learn better online or FTF), the structure of the course retains integrity and learning goals are still achieved.-Made me question and explore what exactly a brick and mortar institution does for the students & community-Made me realize how much the brick and mortar institution requires students for advanced functions - such as research, services, athletics, and community engagement.My university serves a region in rural Appalachia and a commuter student base, about 20% live on campus and 30% live in neighborhoods around campus and the rest live in the surrounding rural and mountainous areas.  The issue that arise from this the students access to  internet connectivity.  My courses already used the publishers website for homework and a third party polling app, both of which work fine when students have access to campus wifi.  Once they were dispersed there was no guarantee they could safely access reliable internet at the required times. I had to abandon the polling app, because I couldn't penalize students without internet.  Average attendance went from 70-80% to about 10-20% for the the synchronous lectures. Only one student contacted me via zoom for \"office-hours\" and the general interaction with student approached zero.  This approach entirely defeats the point of paying for a university education if the students end up just watching videos and answering a few questions from a text. I now understand the frustration my colleagues have with teaching online courses and teaching upper level courses to students that took the prerequisites online.     Like many of us, I noticed the scores on the online midterm were much better than the in-class midterm.   However the scores on a final conceptual assessment were worse than expected, when compared with there online midterm grades.  Suggesting this mode of learning wasn't actually improving their understanding. Many colleagues at my university and other had issues with cheating through the Chegg platform, which made us question the validity of any of the online grades.Chegg is the devil. I'm finding it nearly impossible to administer tests fairly. Too many restrictions, and I disadvantage students. Too few restrictions, and the students commit academic integrity violations.I used Zoom and a web cam to teach my smaller intro physics course synchronously from my living room at the usual meeting times.  My students loved and appreciated preserving the normalcy of the course routine.I learned that everything takes longer.  Every tool you add into a video lecture takes lecture time to use. Students are stressed and easily distracted by roommates or family. They feel that it takes longer to grasp concepts.  Students complain about learning in an environment that was a non-learning (fun) environment before and the dissonance they feel because of this. I learned that at risk students are put more at risk by remote learning. Students with some kinds of ADHD really struggle without the structure of coming to class.  I learned to communicate more and to open more lines of communication (even gave them my cell phone number so they could text).  I learned that we are all have to work as partners to make the class work.Columbia handled the transition to online teaching reasonably well. Classes were cancelled March 9-10 so that faculty could prepare to teach online the next 3 days before Spring Break. Zoom sessions were booked automatically for regularly scheduled classes and accounts were set up for all instructors.I thought it went fine and so did the students, but of course it was a lot more prep on my end recording some lectures.  I was also worried that I was not following all the things I've heard are best practice in the field. (For example, my asynchronous recordings were a lot longer than ~10 minutes)I think that in some ways, the online version of the course is better than the face-to-face version, but in other ways it is worse. It is much more difficult to get the students to interact with each other during the synchronous meeting times. I think this is partially due to technology (some don't have dependable internet, and few have the ability to write with a digital pen), but it is also cultural (they typically use the internet for passive consumption of information). I am also having an issue preventing cheating on homework and exams, whereas that's easier to prevent in a face-to-face setting. I like to do lots of demo experiments and make time to play with them and even allow students to interact with them. I've come up with some home demos, but not nearly as much. That said, this has forced me to make videos of the lecture-part of the class, rather than using some in-class time to do this. I can make this available asynchronously and use normal meeting times to work together on homework problems and tutorials. The biggest issue is students don't know how to get students to better engage and discuss with each other online - it's difficult to monitor progress in zoom rooms and organically switch back and forth between small and large group discussions.Typically, my class is fairly interactive, and I have a reasonable grasp of how confused my students feel (not always the same as how confused they are) in person, and I wasn’t able to find adequate replacements for these in the time allotted during the semester.  The chief problem was significant cheating on the exams, particularly the first one back, hence the use of Respondus, which had problems but seemed to help.  I practiced the lecture portion during the extended spring break with and worked out a mandatory post -lecture feedback mechanism.  It was inadequate but better than nothing in replacing in-class participation.The main issue for me was *not* the switch to online teaching, but rather the switch to teaching with a 1 and 4 year old at home.  My wife is also a physics professor, and had a higher teaching load than me this semester.  I didn't have the luxury of \"worrying\" about my teaching or trying to do a \"great job\" of teaching online.  I almost didn't answer the survey, because I *still* have no time for anything but the most critical things.  But I wanted to respond because I suspect there are statistically more people in my position than you will get responses from.(to the last question:  no thanks--I haven't had 30 minutes to myself since this started!)I taught as a semi-traditional lecture, with a screen-share where I showed slides and hand-wrote notes on a tablet. The hardest part was getting student participation; breakout sessions were unwieldy and students were more reluctant to speak up than they are in face-to-face instruction.In the future I think I will do pre-recorded short lectures for the students to watch, and then run class as an open problem solving session with breakout groups.I reduced expectations and became more student-focused. Office hours by zoom were important.The class I teach is a physics lab. So when it went online it was challenging to change the entire plan of the rest of the semester and figure out online activities. Most of the activities were given by the lab manager and then I forward it to my students. Some of the students had a hard time with the software which caused delays and extra work.It was VERY stressful for the first week, and changing the exams from written to online multiple choice was very stressful.  But I had great help from my very smart grader, who learned and taught me how to randomize the question order in groups of questions of the same value.  That appears to have worked, and kept the students from cheating when taking the final exam remotely.Only had one class to worry about due to a pre-existing teaching release, and that was a small upper-level E&M course.  Probably the easiest class of course to shift to online, with a small number of cluefull and motivated students.  Disruptions were much larger in the big service courses which make up most of our department's workload.  So, I'm not hte best person to talk to about this.Transition to online was rapid with almost no time to strategize and debug before launch. Very stressful.I had to prepare lecture notes that contained some of the details I would otherwise explain at the blackboard. That took quite some time because I normally ask students to read different textbooks that cover the same material.I had much less feedback from the students if they comprehended that material. One simply cannot replace the information one gets when one looks at the students during class.I taught upper division E&M and transitioned to Zoom after spring break (late March).  We used breakout rooms rather than having students work together in small groups as we did in person. In a nominal 80-minute class we typically used 20 - 30 minutes for such activities.  In some ways, the students interacted with each other more using these breakout rooms.  Of course, one group did not hear what other groups were saying to each other, or hear their conversations with me.  That was a downside.  The more serious problem was that before the shutdown many students would work together outside of class, meeting informally in the atrium of the \"Student Learning Center\" (just a room with desks, chairs, and a coffee pot).  It *seems* there was less of. this done online.I had done a little bit of preparation for the students before Covid19 happened because I saw it coming in advance.  I changed my brief in-class lectures to short youtube videos.  The rest of the class was coding-focused, and I was able to do most of that online.  The big challenge was student engagement. I dropped the attendance requirement because students may not be able to attend all the time, and that meant I didn't see most of the students any more.  I do not have a solution to that.I didn't feel any difference in my delivery method as I taught synchronous classes. I missed looking at my students face and adjust my teaching dynamically as I am used to. I feel sad my students and  I lost the personal office hours where they shared their personal stories and had a feeling of belonging. I tried hard to recreate it online but it only worked partially.Largest challenge was time.  My spouse worked full-time and our two young children (one with severe autism) were home with no child-care.  It required me taking care of the children during the day and on weekends. Synchronous hours were fortunately discouraged by the university or it would have been impossible.Next largest challenge was the \"happy aren't we all doing well\" emails from senior administration that seemed to have no understanding of the very different experience of parents with young children.My class was not a typical, high-content physics class, but rather about shepherding about 22 students through the experience of writing up physics research.  The transition to online was made easier by the fact that the students already had a well-established cohort and the class had met face-to-face for 2 terms prior.  I am more concerned about the same class next year, when I will have to establish the cohort remotely.  The hardest part is engaging with 25 blocks on a screen - most students turn off video to conserve bandwidth.  I like the breakout room feature of Zoom.  (The students seem to as well). It gets discussion going.I had two classes and a lab.  My large class I pre-recorded lectures, my small, upper-level class we met synchronously and the lab we adapted the remaining labs with PhETs.  I am most concerned with test integrity with large classes.  Apparently in other departments at my university they had rampant cheating.  I had a few suspicious incidents but nothing nailed on, or I just missed it, but this is a real concern.  We are also preparing lab kits in order to have students do real experiments if we must do this again in the Fall.It was exciting to try and run labs online. The result though was that student writing and analysis were poorer.I was unhappy with the exams. I believe there was some cheating. Some students turned exams hours and even days late.On-line teaching presents inherent communication deficiencies.I assigned on-line lectures but I don't think most students used them. The on-line sessions turned into problem solving sessions, which students enjoyed. I used an iPad with a stylus for writing using Zoom.Used to online teaching, but only as part of course. Seriously missed direct contact, meeting in the class room, and face-to-face interaction.I had to work harder to keep the class engaged.Delivery of content was not an issue, as there are many available existing online resources with good production quality to choose from.  The issue that no one in our department could adequately address was academic dishonesty when taking exams/quizzes/tests, etc.  In STEM fields such as physics, there are multiple online resources that have extensive banks of sample problems, making designing of truly original assessments particularly difficult.I think online classes are enormously effective for large enrollments in which the student-to-instructor contact is barely existent in the face-to-face setting. Better to record lectures once for all, with the students accessing at any time, and then go for recitations in small classes, and to offer more office hours. The case of graduate instruction is different, and it would be preferable in this case to have face-to-face interactions is quite beneficial.In any event we have to rethink this inefficient routine of going to class with notes and repeating every year the same stuff. Consider also that we could address a much large audience with online courses, which is extremely important since about one person each 10,000 in the world has a scientific education.Another advantage of online classes is that people with disabilities, either instructors or students, can participate in the teaching and learning process in a much easier setting. I can envision for example that a brilliant instructor in a wheelchair can continue to work without any major issue, something impossible with the traditional approach. Same of course for students. It is also worth to point out the enormous reduction in CO2 emission if classes are taught from home, reducing to zero the commuting time and allowing more time for research, teaching, free time, and family.The hardest part of assessing student engagement.In thinking about likely online delivery of content in fall, my biggest challenge will be engaging students in content posted in the LMS (Canvas in my case).  Analytics from spring semester showed roughly only 1/3 of students regularly viewed content.  At present, my plan is to embed reading content and video lectures (in manageable, short clips) in LMS quizzes so that students will be prompted to answer questions about content as they go along.  Also, online tests with Respondus Monitor can be improved by use of wired WebCams that can be used to view a student's workspace rather than viewing the student's face exclusively.  I hope to be able to require that in fall.I absolutely hate it.  Having face to face contact is an important part of learning physics. It's not history after all and I need to read faces to tell if my students are getting it.I tried to keep the same approach and learning expectations in order to reduce the disruption.  I didn't anticipate how large the disruption actually was for students in terms of the patterns and pacing of the class.  Over the four weeks we were online in the spring I got more intentional about arranging deadlines to pace the work.  I thought giving more time was helpful but sometimes it wasn't if it meant that too many things were due around the same time.  Finding a pattern for lectures & associated \"in-class\" work, labs, and homework that was regular but spread the deadlines out was important.  I extended deadlines but I made students request extensions individually and tell me what was going on.  I granted them all for just about any reason, but I think they felt a lot better if they could tell me why and communicate their struggles.  This was a very different circumstance than a course that was online from the beginning.  Many of the lessons have more to do with a sudden and unanticipated transition and student stress than they have to do with online teaching.I had a class of ten people, so in addition to online lectures I sent individual mails about all the assignments, andgave unlimited resubmission opportuities.   About 2/3 of the students took advantage of this, and it worked outwell for them although it took lots of my time.   About 1/3 of the students fell behind.   I don't know if theywere distracted by all the stuff that was going on, or just taking advantage of the free pass/fail options that ouruniversity offered.I delivered the lectures synchronously, but I also was recording the lectures so students could see them at a later time. I tracked whether the students would use these recording, and they did a lot! I did not expect this. I guess it was helpful for homework, when the students had to solve similar problems.I was teaching a face-to-face and asynchronous online class during our Jan-April session. Obviously the impact to the asynchronous online class was minimal. I'm teaching a flipped hybrid currently.Learning to write on the Wacom tablet took some time along with figuring out what software to use for writing and sketching, and recording. Adjusting labs was a bit difficult. I have incorporated taking pictures and short movie clips of performing the lab experiments.Normally, I observe students reaction, adjust the speed accordingly, and often repeat difficult derivations in a different way. All this does not work in online setting: teaching feels like talking to an empty room. Also, I found it necessary to write and distribute the lecture notes. Some students appreciated the effort, but it takes a lot of time.Preparing classes online is more time-consuming for the instructor than teaching it in person. Having good video recording software makes things easier.I found it more difficult to gauge whether students really knew how to solve the problems.  Very few seemed to take advantage of virtual office hours via Blackboard Collaborate Ultra.I recorded audio of me giving my lecture and provided an mp3 and a pdf of my notes to my students.  Students were so pleased that they didn't have to stream class or download a huge video file.  Internet speed was a major issue for some students and for me as well.  I do just fine teaching online with the technology, etc. but I hate it compared to in person teaching.I moved to conducting lectures synchronously online for my two classes, which were quite different from one another, and required different strategies. For my 64-student gen-ed, I used powerpoint on Zoom, encouraged students to ask questions using the chat. I had four TAs available to supervise team-based activities once a week in breakout rooms. For breakout rooms, I first tried having supergroups where there was 1 TA/room with multiple teams in the room, but that did not work. I shifted to 1 team per breakout room, with TAs moving between a subset of rooms to check on students. There were numerous challenges, mainly to do with students being able to do modified lab-like activities in their homes - for some, this was not possible. I tried to make sure at least one person per team could do the activity, and then discuss it within their team. My one remaining exam was open-book, timed and delivered through the online system. Problems were grouped by topic. Once you opened a set of problems, you had to submit within a fixed time interval. However, the whole exam was available for 24 hours. Instead of a final, I had a paper and online presentations.For my upper-level physics class, with 18 students, it was challenging to run a traditional lecture. I began by handwriting and uploading notes that I went through on Zoom - the students hated this, it went too fast for them. I tried purely writing on OneNote - too slow. The compromise was to handwrite and upload scanned notes before class, and then annotate them using OneNote. This worked better, but it was still hard for students to stay focused. Going forward, I would intersperse my lecture with short problems for them to do, do make the learning more active. I modified the exam to be take-home, open book, and to be completed within 48 hours.What I took away from this experience, as a novice online instructor, but one who is comfortable with technology, is that each class needs to be tailored so that student learning outcomes are minimally affected, and are what you would like them to be.I actually found it possible to engage students with active questions during lecture - maybe even more easily than with in-person lectures.  Somehow students feel less intimidated online.Much of my course was already in the LMS. For the course that transitioned, it was details to getting synchronous videoconferencing and deploying exams online.I found that I needed to develop strategies combating student fatigue and loss of interest.I have used completely typed lectured for several years now, so transitioning was not a problem.The most difficult aspect of teaching online via zoom, which was the case for me in the spring (only 8 graduate students), is to get students' feedback during class. Interactive teaching is what I always like, but it was nearly impossible for my class in the spring. I also found it difficult not being able to write on blackboard (e.g., deriving equations, ...). We are learning to how to do better for the fall and I believe that the difficulties will be largely removed in the fall in case we have to do online teaching again in the fall.The main difficulty was widespread cheating on online exams aided by the cheating company CheggI got pretty overwhelmed by the amount of information and suggestions coming out, especially since most of it was the same, so I just put together something on Blackboard and made sure it worked.  Homework and grading were already online, although purely electronic administration of the quizzes and exams had some bumps on startup.I delivered my first online exams, which consisted entirely of multiple-choice questions, randomized in order. I had to make this transition quickly, and didn't have time to learn best practices for online exams.  I generally have a different format for in-class exams.  Averages for these online exams were extraordinarily high (e.g. 90% or more, when in-class exams were typically close to 70% for an average).  I discovered some of my exam questions on Chegg.com, so I'm quite sure there was rampant cheating, but have no time or methods to truly figure out who was cheating.  Any solutions to this issue would be vital for future \"online\" course offerings.I have lots to learn about \"Zooming\" a class so that students can ask questions during the lecture--which I miss.  I also believe there is something about a consistent meeting time that makes it easier for all.I had a large 4 by 6 foot white board brought over to my house and lectured more or less as normal using zoom. The students submitted homework as pdf's through email. Similarly for take home exams. Student interaction was good. They frequently asked questions during the lectures. I also frequently asked the students how it was going as compared to other approaches and they always said they were happy with the lectures. My only concern was that I was never totally happy with the lighting.The short notice was a big problem.  Its a lab+lecture course in which most of the grade is associated with the lab and exams.  The course is Observational Astronomy and the lab entails using telescopes, so it was difficult to find suitable virtual substitutes.  The biggest problem however with any online course as I now perceive it, is giving exams and meaningful homework and lab grades, because it seems impossible to insure independent work.It turned out to me that online teaching (my upper-level grad course with 10ish students) is quite easy.Did Powerpoint instead of real-time solutions of problems.The greatest difficulty was assessing students' understanding during lectures, since most students kept their cameras turned off, or the picture was hidden on my screen.Preparing for and teaching online was much more stressful and time-consuming than my previous teaching of  face-to-face classes.I find it hard to get students involved in on-line class or to check if they participate because most of the time they just mute their camera and their microphone for the entire class sessionI transitioned an advanced lab (senior physics majors) class to online. It was completely different, but it worked great. I got to include machine learning and the analysis of ATLAS and LIGO open datasets into our curriculum.Our university is very well equipped for this transition.Keep continuous contact with students so they stay tuned and they feel they're not alone.Evaluating homework and take-home exams was difficult.  I had the students email the assignments to me in whatever form they wanted to use. Then I had to use clumsy text editors to put comments and number grades on their work.The biggest mistake I think we made was not even trying to require synchronous activities (giving students the ability to request to be excused, as necessary).  We were initially persuaded by arguments of our colleagues that a lot of students would not be able to make synchronous classes, but we hoped a lot of students would show up for labs and Friday group work, but very few (less than 10%) did.  So students did these activities on their own or in self-organized groups.  This is an intro physics course for life science students, and our students are not as motivated as the engineering students, who did show up for group work.  So one of our big questions is what can we require, given such disparate circumstances. Our biggest concern going forward to the fall was using Chegg to cheat on exams.  This happened in all of our intro courses.  Exams were the biggest technical challenge:  how long of a window to give?  how to deliver the questions?  how to have students upload answers?Generally, we didn't reorganize/rethink the course in any big way, we just used Zoom to carry on as usual, using breakout rooms for group work.  A lot of our work was on learning some details of Zoom and of recording lectures.  We also had just started to use Gradescope this semester, which turned out to be a lucky decision.The most challenging problem is giving exams online.  Cheating is a big issue.The transition to online instruction was relatively straightforward for me during the spring term, as I had already given the midterm and arranged a final project in lieu of a final. I am much more concerned about the fall, when we are being asked to prepare for both in person and online instruction simultaneously.I basically took my in-person lecture and lectured via Zoom with an iPad.  These lectures were given synchronously during the regular lecture time.  However, they were also recorded.  The recorded lectures and pdfs of the lecture notes were uploaded online and available asynchronously to students.  Homework was still do at the usual time, and given weekly.  The difficulty of the homework did not decrease, although I started adding extra credit points.  The 2nd Midterm and Final Exam changed from in-person exams to take home exams.  Hence, students had more time to complete them.  The homework and exams were posted on Blackboard, and the students were asked to upload their solutions onto Blackboard as well (although they were allowed to email the solutions if it worked better.)  Then their graded homework/exams were posted back onto Blackboard.I would like to comment on synchronous vs. asynchronous.  We had a strong push at our institution to make everything asynchronous for accessibility issues.  While accessibility is a major concern, it is possible to solve this problem by being synchronous and asynchronous.  Dropping the synchronous lectures fundamentally misunderstands out students.  This is one reason I didn't like to our teaching centers, because I felt they did not understand the needs of our students and weren't listening to faculty.  Just like faculty did not sign up for teaching online courses, students did not sign up to take online courses and it's likely they never took online courses before.  Going purely asynchronous is a gigantic disruption in their learning, as they were getting kicked off campus.  There lives centered around the rhythms of campus and then that was taken away.  It was our responsibility as faculty to give as much semblance of normality as possible, and help keep their schedules.  Additionally, these students are not used to having to set their own schedules and to expect them to do such at the same time they are kicked off campus, the economy cratered, and there was a global pandemic puts undo burden upon the students.So what I learned:  Try to keep things as much normal as possible, and as seemless transition as possible. Do not use a huge amount new technology that the students have to learn.  Set your expectations and communicate them early.  Also, regularly communicate reminding them about homework/lectures and telling them to take care of themselves.  Everybody understood that this was less than an ideal circumstance, and I found the students responded fantastically if you showed that you understand and care a little.  Finally, do not increase or decrease your expectations for the course, but give more avenues for them to improve their grades. I would also like to note in the end I passed everybody who did the work.  A note about your questions: One of the questions asked how helpful different software were for teaching.  I answered \"very helpful\" for both of them.   I would like to note that Blackboard is generally helpful even for face-to-face, but something like Zoom is only useful for online teaching.  Also, there was a question characterizing Blackboard as \"new\" but I have quite a bit of experience using it, so it is not \"new.\"I just learned how to use Zoom and online quizzes in Canvas. Other online components (homework, lab assignments) have already been implemented into the face-to-face part of the class before the transition to onine teaching.I was already familiar with Blackboard before, so I had no problem adopting quickly. In addition, I have a complete training in Math-Education which helped adjust lesson-plan as quickly on the need basis when COVID-19 policy came in to force.Student feedback (questions, comments) is nearly non-responsive.  They are reluctant to ask questions, especially when I record the session (which they requested).  They never stop me or interrupt to ask questions. I never know if they are paying attention?  I cannot have video going  for everyone since it ruins the bandwidth on occasion and since I am recording, if the session breaks, it is difficult for me to piece the videos together, and it is very disruptive to the flow of the class. The fear of bandwidth problems  has led me to avoid video, and so I cannot really see the students reactions to anything I teach.  It is basically lecturing into a black hole.I was teaching a smaller class, so I thought it was reasonable to continue trying to meet synchronously with the students, to allow continued \"in-class\" discussion (I also recorded if students needed to miss the class/had connection issues, etc.). I was previously comfortable with talking and presenting in Zoom, so that was less of a challenge than fining ways to rebalance some of the activities/evaluations. While the class went ok, it definitely lacked the good discussions allowed in class, and made some of the other aspects of evaluation challenging. I was fortunate and glad that it happened for this course, and not one of my intro Physics+lab courses that I often teach, though!I team-taught an IPLS course that included a lab component.  We used Zoom for lectures and lab.  For the labs, we recorded videos and photos of the procedures and tried to provide as many decision points for students as possible to maintain the authentic lab experience; this worked rather well.  We used Gradescope and MasteringPhysics for our online assesements, and these worked well technically, but some students took advantage of the circumstances to cheat - we had a record number of Honor Code violations.It made me hope that we might just fucking dump grades entirely and transition to an educational system, rather than a credentialing system. I know, I dream big, and there's little hope that will happen.Is this just for US universities?I am at New York University Abu Dhabi, UAE.My university provided all the tools and online help I needed. The transition to Zoom was fairly smooth. But I was not teaching a lab course - that would have been more problematic.I was already using WebAssign and iClickers, so the biggest day-to-day change I made was switching to Zoom lectures. For that reason, the transition went much more smoothly than I had anticipated. Exams were a bit more of a challenge. I did not use Respondus or anything similar due to concerns about students’ internet connectivity, so I did have concerns about academic integrity during exams. Scores were noticeably higher for “virtual” exams.not pleasant, no colloboration in my department, no clear guidanceA major disadvantage in quality and ability to use empathetic involvement.Like most people, I feel like we were just thrown into it.A few people were better prepared since they already recorded lectures as a backup or made efforts to do some things on-line or were short of teaching assistants, so they made more effort to make homework more self-guided.... Most of us, I would say were thrown in cold turkeyI had already had nearly all assignments submitted and graded online, along with posting class notes on the course website even prior to transitioning from face-to-face class meetings to online (I still had a synchronous class meeting that I held via zoom, but posted alternatives for students to participate somewhat asynchronously if they needed to). Based on class poll results, almost none of my students had any prior experience with video conferencing services like Zoom, however, so I did an in-class primer prior to the official online transition. I got a lot of positive feedback from students for doing this, but it would not have been possible to do if I had relied solely on the official university-wide communications regarding if transitioning was going to occur or not. I will mention that I have a lot of 'dependents' both professionally (e.g. research staff and students, etc.) and personally- and the online transition, even with my prior experience from research settings, was extremely stressful for me as a result, and I had to essentially halt all research activities (even though my research is computational in nature and can be done remotely by both me and my research group). I estimate I put in at least 1, 18-hour work day in addition to my standard workload for about 2 months in addressing student emergencies (or even just referring them to the appropriate campus office to contact). Many of which caused major access issues for them in being able to function in an online class such as lack of high speed internet access, getting locked out of the LMS for long periods of time, lack of access to electronic devices like laptops (so some only had access to smartphones for turning in work, accessing the class website, etc.), major upheaval due to life events like job loss, seriously ill family members, and in one case eviction during a stay-at-home order. So it is super important to incorporate inclusive methods in online course design and implementation! As an instructor, I also did not feel particularly supported by my department during this experience, so I sought and found more support online (sometimes starting on twitter) and from reading blogs, etc.I miss being able to do demonstrations, especially those with student participation. Videos are not the same.Otherwise, except for the technical stuff that had to be learned, it has been OK. Office hours are actually better.Because it was a seminar and it was less than 10 students, it was an easy transition. We had to completely drop their group projects because they were impossible to do remotely. Because our class was working closely together in small groups before we disbanded, and we all knew each other well, I think it went fine. For larger traditional content classes, I think the most important thing will be to form these small groups study groups and have them form contracts with each other on how they will contribute and be responsible to help each other learn. For our group projects, before disbanding, students had to rubric/checklist they used to evaluate themselves and their group members at 4 points in the semester. I think this would be a good thing to implement in a study group or lab team, to make sure they have a learning community if they are remote.My comment about interviewing which I couldn't add below: I'd be happy to discuss teaching (I LOVE talking about teaching), but i don't know how helpful it would be since my seminar class was not challenging to move online.This was not what you would call online teaching...Our institution called it remote. It was performed in real time, the transition was on a very short notice, and the preparation was really poor. I was not able to find sufficient information about remote, real time delivery of instructional materials (again, this was not online teaching!) so I tried my best given the conditions. Trial and error works! The biggest challenge was the lack of technological resources for students (computer, internet access, bandwidth, accessories, etc). I included specific questions about the remote experience in the class evaluations; it was not as bad as I expected, and I think I am better prepared if I have to teach remotely in the near future.Although it was relatively straightforward to transition my lectures and assignments online, I lost much of the group/peer instruction aspect and was never comfortable implementing it using our online tools.Teaching online has been exhausting and demoralizing.  It takes the same or more time to run a class online, and while the geographic and circadian freedom an async online class allows is substantial, I don't want to do this long-term.  I think the learning online does not live up to the in-person standard, particularly because the student-student and student-faculty communication is so limited and clunky. I worry that an MBA somewhere will take Spring 2020 as an existence proof that all teaching should go online and our society (and universities) will go down the drain in the same way uber has decimated the taxi industry and airb&b has decimated real estate markets.Worked really hard. Did not feel guided by my college.College has made no statements regarding cheating and FERPA concerns for faculty observing students.1. Should have used the simulation software more rigorously.2. I had to completely rewrite the lab manual for half the content (The online content)3. Should have kept attendance as a graded item. (It was removed as a graded item during remote instruction)4. I obtained good success with the online rework. I was able to engage the students with all the content of the face to face content.5. Students adapted well to online experience.6. Students did lose the physical context of using real devices and constructing real circuits. How great is that loss is unclear right now.Actually, it was more or less possible (it seemed) to transition our SCALE-UP class to an online virtual environment using Zoom without too much trouble.  Students were able to use breakout rooms for group work, and Zoom offers polling capability to enable clicker questions.  Students were able to capture and share their group work from whiteboard activities, and they were able to annotate questions or figures displayed by the instructor.  While I am not saying that it matched the in-class experience, it was not such a bad approximation.I coordinate the engineering physics sequence. We had few cases we suspect of cheating on the final exam. That one thing makes me proud but the method we used was very labor intensive. We will do something different for the fall for tests but I don't know what it is. The university encouraged us to be flexible with students as their internet may not have been good at home and they may have challenges - this meant we eliminated the attendance requirement for synchronous attendance. A large percentage of our team posted pre-recorded (by someone else) videos of content for students to watch and hosted some \"class time\" in person. Attendance was tiny. Students disengaged. Homework scores dropped. Faculty were discouraged by having to talk to impersonal \"black boxes\" on a screen that didn't even have student photos! And, in a class where the typical attendance would be 100 - less than 40 would attend the live sessions. My personal live sessions never had more than 10 students. We want to focus on flipping the classroom for the fall and being intentional about using breakout rooms for student engagement for the lectures. We did keep one component of the course \"synchronous\" which was our small group work sessions led by TAs. We doubled the TAs and used Zoom whiteboard and annotate feature. We are unlikely to have enough staffing to maintain that for the fall. For spring - we continued using WebAssign. Ramped up using Moodle to share videos and to do testing. Right now - in summer - I am testing Gradescope and Respondus monitor and will make a proposal to the faculty about testing plans for fall within a month.I only had 8 sessions left when we went online.  We muddled through those 8 session together.Since I had about 250 students, with a sizable percentage in other timezones, I opted for an asynchronous class mode where I pre-recorded all lectures. I had an extra-credit quiz for each lecture to motivate students to watch them in time. I also held active discussion sessions in a variety of times where students had to turn in their work at the end. One of the biggest challenges for me was dealing with online examinations and all the associated complications. I think one of the biggest challenges for students was adjusting to the online mode and finding the calm and discipline needed to succeed in the class while being at home. I ended up with an abnormally wide distribution of grades.The challenges were with online labs and cheating on exams.  No one seems to have a fail-safe solution to the cheating.  Chegg was the worst offender.If teaching online again, I'd prefer that students simply watch well-curated video lectures that already exist, then I use zoom to solve problems and discuss concepts with the students.  I don't know how to do this yet; I don't know what well-curated lectures I can point my students to.  I will look into this if it appears that I will be teaching online in Fall semester.\n"

We teaching fully hybrid flipped classroom years difference f2f online class you're physically not. All resources, homework, support available online hit. We online, hybrid, f2f students attending synchronous lectures, interacting breakout groups mixed form. We've option attend creating asynchronous assignments couple years.

Main shortcoming online class inability maintain Breakout Room student assignment class class, university/college/department having institutional license Zoom instead relying flexible technologies like WebEx. This hindered peer instruction, students \"break ice\" anew group problem online class.The class I taught semester transitioned online (about 2/3 way through) small upper-level undergrad class 6 students, transition ability lecture online easier.

I abandoned clear ending long.One it, necessary, real teaching/learning (at classes involve critical thinking, simply acquiring defined set skills/\"information units\"/useful \"knowledge tools\". I may, course, wrong; case, I'm expendable - physics faculty universities. Online teaching (for, e.g., graduate physics courses), meaningful desirable, efficiently centralized manner relatively small number highly qualified people. Otherwise, avoided, taking risks.I physics teaching assistant, courses I teach larger course taught main instructor. The way recitations work course, however, they're twice weekly lectures, smaller group. When transitioned online classes, main instructor course moved Khan Academy provide students instructional material. While Khan Academy materials useful information, aren't lectures, I ended taking bulk lecturing responsibilities. I provide lecture regular course time Zoom edit upload video footage lecture students tune regular class time access material. Based emails students sent course evaluations, students valued course structure felt like kept things close normal been. Some bit frustrated Khan Academy videos wanted regular lectures main instructor well. So, limited experience small sample size, I providing synchronous Zoom lecture normal, whiteboard lecture, asynchronous video uploaded afterward meet needs students well, prerecorded videos institutions bit helpful.While transition abrupt (the instructors) scramble figure things work, especially terms group work (tutorials, labs), helped students instructors knew other. This allowed maintain strong sense community high level interaction transition. This harder achieve group students met other. Indeed, previous experience teaching asynchronous MOOC, tried add synchronous office-hours type sessions week, students participated. We tried create community discussion board, lot success getting students interact other.It easy I figured breakout rooms Teams student small groups.I like teaching synchronously lecture capture (for students miss class), LearningCatalytics, MasteringPhysics, e-text. The 3 essential online teaching, change. I students participate synchronously, LearningCatalytics real-time TPS questions useful (and longer graded participation). Delivering exams problematic. We access Respondus' Lockdown Browser Monitor, I tried use both. Most students use adequately, turned useful attempting detect cheating. I assume students willing attempt cheating, adapt attempt cheat future (they easily side-stepped device). I able deliver multiple-choice self-graded exams Blackboard.We FlipitPhysics years textbook online homework system, lucky - lectures built requiring students anyway. I initially relied this, Zoom office hours (daily), detailed notes I posted. I added voice-over notes. I spend lot time (much pre-Covid) answering emails students. I seen service work time meetings skyrocket.I'm teaching special program select group incoming undergraduates (first years transfer students). It's low-level, focused content that's research-aligned, intro physics. I hoped good interactive web content videos available, I dismayed options (nothing interactive, nearly featured white male expert), I decided worth time create content I'd originally intended.I record lectures actual classes met, like 3 times week. Also I prepare multiple choice questions. Other nice transition. I love online teaching gives time spend family teach I love others.I ranked usefulness tools zoom classmeetings online grading perspective I teach class them. I want clear, however, I choice use tools importantly, *NONE* supplant face face instruction hands laboratory experiences.My students turn cameras zoom sessions. I hard gauge engagement visual queues. Student performance Homework bit historical averages test performance statistically indistinguishable previous years.Everyone video muted class. After week, difficult engage conversation questions.As TA didnt control. We recorded expirements students watch usual work.My class lot blackboard anyways hybrid class wasn't issue. Mostly second half semester hands work, class lacked aspect.The main challenge finding effective way administer online exams. Exams implemented LMS I 100% sure cheating, I strategies free-response questions, selecting questions random pool on.It took 3-4 times time prepare online video lectures compared preparing face-to-face lecture. It important students' faces class, react, behave, etc. Without instant feedback, feels impossible judge able follow lectures I adjust pace level accordingly. It feels like I'm talking wall, demotivating too, affects teaching badly. I important regular basis, difficult meeting them. I need zoom lot individually I regular weekly discussions, up-side-down schedules (no structure provided regularities classes discussions). Thus, accommodate needs I (a lot) time before. Online teaching feels like cheating them, providing university experience relies communication interaction.Given technology disparities, difficulties studying homes, chaotic schedules unexpectedly have, important afford students opportunity participate asynchronously.Students want interactions instructor. Talking short video conference better received sending students resource page - according evaluations submitted spring semester.Shared screens breakout rooms Zoom work surprisingly well. It MUCH better students write screen (e.g. tablet) mouse.My face face class traditional. I use chalk chalkboard, I use document writer large screen (a digital projector) write notes class talk class I write. Even face-to-face, COVID19, I post lecture notes, homework, quiz, exam solutions Blackboard. All students know exact grade times. Transitioning online easy, simply point web cam legal pad start teaching Zoom, regular class (except don't I live demos). Students appreciated learn new tech transition classes. The BIGGEST problem online teaching cheating exams ways police ensure cheating. Overall, despite ~1/3 class taught online, success. Some comments indicate traditional course, students like delivery method (before COVID19). Here comments students end semester teaching evaluations: \"What great course! I come course prior love physics high school horror stories college physics. I understand horror, fun newfound knowledge definitely outweighs nastier parts including equations. This course rekindled love learning. I proud parents I calculate torque, final velocity, possibly angular momentum super specific conditions.

I showed PowerPoint slides appropriate recorded narrative. These watched asynchronously. I canvas deliver lessons. Problem sets assigned synchronous time optional And San office hour explain concepts help homework. They started attended dwindled time. I tenure review observed evaluation entire experience deeply traumatizing.I started fairly excited opportunities, I rapidly concerned students didn't internet access synchronous classes. My assessment strategies relied achieving mastery oral re-takes exams. So I threw window. The 4 weeks, I managed record post lectures gave home quiz typical class time. I managed 3rd exam, worried tremendously stressed anxious students feeling. I severely discouraged failings instructor caring students. I ended offering A work completed point. It 2nd semester Quantum class, I'm concerned I'm setting failure limiting content likely won't need continue education. Just felt like I equal parts helping failing them. What shit show.It vastly inferior in-person teaching.Since students didn't sign distance education weeks (of 14) regular instruction (which uses LON-CAPA online homework Top Hat in-class responses), I tried maintain experience close regular classroom experience before, synchronous lectures usual class time recorded couldn't follow synchronously. I eventually figured set break-out rooms in-class activities 9 person tables, awkward visit Microsoft Teams. In talking student advisees (I 20), quasi-synchronous way faculty department adopted popular (at odd semester) fully online approaches departments tried. The diversity different approaches got departments confusing them. Our faculty preparing online fall, especially lab materials demos (which transition distance learning format).Asynchronous lectures/ synchronous group work supervised prof TA (10-11am 11-12pm eastern US). Zoom breakouts group work.Tried cause little disruption possible students - kept class times, online homework system, moved Canvas-based quizzes.It upper-division lab class (wasn't options) lab work translate all. Fortunately, 5 weeks semester students completed 5 7 experiments, work. We gave students data experiments didn't complete themselves, reduced points grade reflected beginning semester. We lot videos explain physics principles showing experiments performed linked canvas.There big difference emergency transition planned transition (such upcoming fall). Essentially forgiven emergency, things higher stakes fall.I video recordings lectures. The exams changed in-class, closed book partial credit online, open book, multiple choice exams. My greatest concern students cheat online exams, having friend help them. I good way stop current environment.Chaos stress!It work progress. Each session completely rewritten online instruction. I believed going lesson best work. I learned class I wanted improve. So lessons I taught end semester took advantage lessons learned, effective initial online lessons.Shut Chegg down.We're quarter system, transitioned spring break (and teaching). Everybody grandmother sent \"how teach online\" links hundreds resources, completely overwhelming result helpful all. (Not mention contradicted other. And included useful info university _had_ template online courses I pulled Canvas.)Most prep time spent class I responded survey (highest-enrollment one, lecture), figuring run lab class remotely.I feel like people trying help counterproductive. From associate dean \"trying help\" changing course fees ways undo, Inside Higher Ed publishing uncountable numbers \"how teach online\" articles... like, imagine showing MIT freshman having single physics professor campus come dorm room telling learn physics once? Individually brilliant insightful helpful, shut ignore by.As results, it's confirmed opinion online sucks. Even right, I'm prepping fall, sucks. The connection students isn't there, messages, discussion boards, Zoom office hours world don't change that.I reliably cover 70% material time. I feeling like friend wrote asynchronous online course. When asked going students, replied, \"I pretend teach them, pretend learn.\"The Red Skelton character Clem Kadidlehopper asked spelled name. \"Wrong, time!\" answer. Sometimes teaching online feels like.preparing video material students bit work worth effort. I'll probably future classes (even face-to-face ones)I happened team teaching, colleague I tried transition \"smooth\" possible (least changes students). We slowed tempo little, generous small issues like late homework, many. HW: Homework scanned submitted online pre post transition. No change. We slightly reduced difficulty length transition loss good study sessions (below)EXAMS: 1st midterm evening, in-class. 2nd midterm final (post transition) time scale, online (using scan method homework.) Students \"Zoomed\" communicate exam (and them). Went smoothly, indication cheating, complaints, issues. We use \"2-stage\" (group) exams pre transition, decided lose transition. LECTURES: Lectured MWF@9 AM. Lecture capture room after-class viewing available term. Continued lecture Zoom, (continued transition, I able use room, Asynchronous videos before) Live attendance dropped significantly, average factor 2 transition. Students' viewing lecture capture videos increased somewhat 20% students regularly viewing 35%... CLICKER QUESTIONS: Stopped transition. Asked questions live Zoom, little student interaction (just responses Zoom chat) IN-CLASS SMALL GROUP ACTIVITIES: Typically (or two) 15-20 minute activities/week transition. Completely stopped transition.STUDY-SESSIONS: We 3 hrs/week staffed study sessions building. Pre transition 30% class came. Post transition continued zoom, handful (5%) showed regularly.Student evaluations extremely strong, liked it. But, half students evaluated! I lost 5% class (dropped) transition, usual. No students usual failed (just couple). Students opt P/F final, I don't know chose this, goes registrar's office. But grade distribution similar past terms, small number (5%) D's F's.I started transitioning class (along pedagogy-focused colleagues) official announcement online teaching. I grounded choices assessment theory thorough understanding means exist online. I D2L tools support in-person learning (D2L quizzes facilitate Just-In-Time Teaching, example), frustrated energy went technologically making online possible energy went online educational environment (at Teaching Learning level). I concerned didn't serve students they're going willing engage online education future.One positive aspect online teaching: zoom chat window feature led far questions lecture received face-to-face instructionWe learned hard lessons difficulties administering online exams terms cheating. If possible, I preferred eliminate exams altogether (or least, eliminate timed non-open-book exams) teaching format. I'll probably try upper-level class I'll teaching semester, continue online instruction. We Gradescope grade exams, switched homework- exam-hosting platform well. It best solution letting students work collaboratively screen sharing, tablets use digitial whiteboards.We quarter system. I zero days implement quiz final exam class 300+ students end winter quarter (early March) forego rest laboratory class meant hands-on. I performed lecture classroom demos video, posted video. This quarter, spring quarter, savvy graduate students pressure video meetings research international based Europe (particle physics). So pretty easy class small.I'm spending extra 10 hours week writing detailed course notes slides, especially students limited bandwidth watching lectures. This sustainable. One surprising note: I'm getting questions now, synchronous lectures, in-person class; lot students like Zoom \"chat\" feature this.I took planned presentations class broke 3–10 minute videos, punctuated single-question zero-stakes quizzes filled iClicker questions. I recommended days students videos. Overall, okay, I overwhelmed creating videos I aware students' actual performance class. Exams ETA time limit access notes textbook. Performance exams in-person exams, style exams, access resources, additional time present multiple variables, I can't constrain students' learning outcomes changed online version course.Exams open-book online, remote proctoring software initially available want honest students disadvantaged. . This reduced incentive understand principles. Instead I saw greater reliance trying 'pattern match' exam questions previous problems. Hopefully reliable remote proctoring place fall return 'single formula sheet' rule exams.it ok, tablet writing skills far worse chalkboard skills. We missed lot hands demos I liked try. I suggest things homes, hard know people access things I consider common household items. I want feel I caused trip grocery store (which likely bus) students. I I managed teaching way, I I happy went.I like add questions poorly described. For example \"what largest class taught\" like semester? ever? I tried comment near 'rate good thing was' question I don't know I supposed compare to. None good person meetings, online tools good job something. I happy zoom worked (not ms teams, skype business blackboard). In short, I sure I answered questions thought asking.I personally think large (>400 case) courses easier transition parts course automated already. For example, homework online. I repository lecture recordings students familiar forum. Having taught smaller classes, I think require transition.We Zoom, I lots difficulty upload speed. Would liked pre-record lecture slides important topics few, lack time. I teach interactively person, difficult online.Have lots handouts tutorials class, I posted instead distributing paper. I posted lots resources canvas face-to-face time, students going online regularly. Homework (MasteringPhysics) online readiness assessment tests.Besides course, I teach associated lab Supplemental Instruction course students, I lot contact I knew students semester. The established learning community feeling helped keeping students engaged. I courses entry points: SI labs breakout rooms small group interaction. I online readiness assessments allow students ask questions connect one-on-one them. I lot time (from announcement online end semester), transition fairly smooth students. I proud I lose course.Challenge design exams administered online; I believe online proctoring (there ways cheat intrudes privacy). My normal exam style questions include free response questions sub-questions, I felt work online. I satisfied multiple choice exams, I needed creative. I missed online option clickers (had I-clicker before). Zoom polls record responded how.It's challenge. I love teaching face face I old fashioned I don't use online HW tests, I ended grading ton stuff student sent online. It's way work, worth sacrifice students think need. I filmed video lectures rapid watch. I Physics II (majors) Stat. Mech. fall. I'll use virtual labs fall. We finished labs spring course face-to-face, I said hell rest aren't great anyway. The poor students looked demoralized Zoom sessions (used help solve physics problems).Students liked recorded lecture videos, including ability replay them. So content delivery went OK. It's possible assure academic integrity online courses use endpoint examinations (known workarounds widely available defeating proctoring software). As result, I trying transition authentic means assessment, recorded video presentations Q & A, etc. Kits Hands Labs (HoL) met learning objectives labs, HoL production bottlenecks added student costs took table. As result, summer, I try conducting synchronous labs home. Students responsible specifying parameters experiment runs (e.g., mass want add cart, etc.). Not sure go. I think insure engagement. Will try fun - I've enlisted wife lab assistant!I learned online teaching poor substitute f2f teaching. Less half students learning useful. Hope good - teach f2f.1. I believe I lot learn improve on-line teachings. 2. Some students better on-line class work home time, I compete work attention. 3. Other students got financial trouble worked 14 hour/day weeks semester having time work homework. 4. Other students got lot issues anxiety. 5. All students got lot value tuition stay home order learned stuff adaptability flexibility normally expose student to.Preparing online lecture time-consuming in-person lecture.I attempted course flexible possible case students (many caregivers, parents, part- full-time jobs) unable continue synchronous attendance. I held lectures regular meeting times recorded them, posting recording class adding closed-captioning. I posted notes I went class day, plus supplemental videos concepts covering. Even I'm MSI (with 2/3 women undergraduates), physics classes remain predominately white male. In general, white male students continued perform course transition, women students students color struggled lower levels privilege access; e.g., high-speed internet, time devote classes \"essential personnel\" increased work hours, family care obligations, loss in-person help office hours. I fear pandemic going disproportionately set minoritized students, leaving mark continues inequity lack representation seen Physics.I spoke length students experience, based collective wisdom, I think thatwhile on-line teaching advantages (snazzy demos, nice graphics, etc.) advantages eye contact real time, face-to-face interaction class does, advanced physics courses. Possibly courses, disciplines, hybrid model amy advantage.From student responses extremely important synchronous. It provides structure students helps engaged. Numerous students mentioned emails. I taught quantum mechanics general relativity way.I teaching large (>100) person intro class, sections coordinated decisions. Therefore, I Zoom-proctored, Moodle-delivered exam choice evaluation. We time test good decisions, hard come consensus remotely. For class fall, I completely away proctored exam structure, frequent, smaller-stakes, standards-based evaluations. Neither students faculty prepared situation, little material taught learned went online teaching.The greatest challenge gauging real-time students following lecture.Assessment (especially exams) biggest challenge. Faculty *as as* students concerned cheating, rampant.I transitioned teaching online years ago I appreciate having multiple years learn Canvas, work Zoom, experiment online teaching tools. The COVID-19 crisis forced instructors confront steep learning curve short period, kudos deserved instructors navigated challenge successfully. Still, successful response today rests heavily shoulders teaching innovations technology refinements accelerating past decade. Without those, transition possible.Having taught online courses past, I video-making experience software needed tech hardware too, I lucky great peace mind going remote teaching phase (which 5 weeks semester, 9 weeks having completed face-to-face week cancelled create 2-week \"spring break\" preparations.Here important phrase consider: Remote TEACHING easy enough; I Remote ASSESSMENT nearly impossible reliably. I'm seeing discussion that. Chegg.com likes big problem STEM classes.Apart expensive tablet platforms, iPad, good tool write equations draw diagrams figures. In physics, far greatest impediment delivering material. Online instruction easily adapted dynamic teaching style instructor draws students discussion.Four physics instructors teaching class - hope agreeing way transition. It everybody themselves.I learned teaching online NOT cracked be. Most students need face-to-face time, less. If establish \"community-of-learners\" online NOT way it. And, number students figured \"game system\" (cheat) inflate grades. This unfair students. And, I uncomfortable \"passing\" students clearly performing prepared advance. This puts enormous burden faculty teaching follow-on courses degrades college degree. It certainly convey student deficiencies, as, undermining purpose college college experience. It feeds perception college \"credentialing\" process educational process.I lower expectations somewhat virtual labs probably rigorous I classroom. I understanding students technology situations. The students entirely buy though. The result higher grades I typically give.By far important aspect transition available students Zoom possible. Recording lectures helps. New platforms help (though I argue complexity minimized). However, letting students know, repeatedly, time meet them, crucial. I weekends, late dinner, I occasionally small Zoom groups trying understand material wrestling mathematical proof I assigned class. Those extra interactions person connecting room, big difference, greatly appreciated.This experience singularly exhausting. Everything work, takes time, considerably personal satisfaction job, effective results.I miss seeing students good-natured banter accompanied Q&A sessions. I receive, though, number positive comments course ended students wanted offer thanks I handled things. I'll teaching totally online summer. I'm pretty confident main class, pretty antsy labs students home.By way, I'll retire end summer, weird way end 40-year career.I think, transition on-line education happened pandemics: time ripe.My prediction on-line education continue higher level pandemics.The useful advice I treat transitioning online teaching like designing online class scratch. My goal replicate interactions assessments happened face face possible. That helped ground quickly planning communicating plans students. I benefit class period person went online I knew switch happening, let test run Zoom students physically room, I think helpful them.When I learned possibility going online, I googled best practices online teaching general Physics particular. I decided short lecture example problem videos students watch asynchronously. For synchronous discussion Zoom. On typical day I post discussion questions answered polling feature, lead good discussion, I students \"Breakout Rooms\" work problem computational project. It worked well. Homework book, assigned class day class day - I flexible late work I usually am.The course I took online second year math computational methods course physics majors. It combines traditional mathematics instruction (lectures, discussion sections, written weekly homework) complementary scientific programming Python (two intro interactive lectures, weekly Jupyter homework). The programmatic provided course JupyterHub server Piazza class discussion simple HTML website I maintained assignments, lecture notes, etc. The things online were: 1. Switch Zoom lectures (recorded different time zones) I asked students interrupt use group chat ask questions/discuss 1-2 simple zoom polls lecture.2. Have homework submitted scanned PDFs (we encouraged students use camscanner equivalent) Dropbox file request link. We marked PDFs iPads grade emailed out.This worked fine.The biggest problems:1. Going essentially untimed home exams (24 48 hours) accommodate multiple time zones meant I write hard use internet cheating. This hard exams worked. Of course, can't guarantee students didn't help that's essentially impossible.2. Peer-to-peer learning (eg. working homework undergrad physics lounge, etc) essentially lost.Transition somewhat easy taught small (14 students) upper-level class attended physics majors physics graduate students.Online teaching poor substitute face-to-face contact. Education mass roduced, particularly upper levels physics. We online to, makes eduational sense.I didn't like transition. It difficult tell students engaged.Interestingly enough, students hated online classes - physics classes, online classes. They especially disliked asynchronous classes. It hard short quizzes exams online - students copied web tried pay solve exams.o depending content lectures pre-recorded posted University server conducted video conference Zoom interaction needed. While I lot positive experience research video conferences challenging good class participation video conference. Lot's responses questions chat window speak up. o However, so-called weekly writing labs TAs succeeded active participation. Key setting break rooms small groups working small class projects.All went I hoped certainly better I feared. I curious student evaluations.The transition smooth. I happened teaching courses I taught online summer years I material I needed prepared. Some adaptation required, much. On surface, student assessed performance change obvious way. I worry things easily tangible communicated online lab experience nearly rich. This true COVID influence semester previous summer classes I taught.Feedback students, final exam I graded, confirm knew: remote teaching replace face face teaching:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEmuEWjHr5cI've received multiple teaching outreach awards past, good teaching lifelong interest. My teaching workload tripled I tried provide semblance reasonable education students, detracts tenure case.I new expectations clear told students repeatedly times feel know going course.During weeks prepare I wanted sure technical glitches eat class time. (Invariably did, minimized). Synchronous learning class I wanted-it helped somewhat preserve community feel . However peer discussion Zoom classes. To facilitate discussion, I walk away meeting minute I hear louder buzz students. We tried breaking smaller groups reconvening clunky gave that. I like fact I record class post document camera class notes. But entire class I missed face face interaction-I gauge understanding, alert puzzled looks feeling tight knit community lost.Since faculty instructed teach \"remotely\" 1 week prepare, I developed steps achieve implemented plan week 3 shut-down. Week 0, Developed policy, syllabus changes, professor contact information. Adjusted calendar class meetings learning objectives class meetings (adding online responsibilities students), sent \"Changes Course Number XXXX\" notice email students. Delivery technology beta testing (camera, laptop choice MAC PC, bandwidth available home provided Xfinity (Speakeasy speed test), preparation lecture materials audio video recording. Finally, I prepared 5 class sessions (scanned handouts-PDF, notes self demonstrative voice delivery attention students typical review lecture material prior class). These classes \"audio only\" lectures delivered asynchronously. The purpose audio lectures meet institutional goals (ready start online/remote delivery Week 1) allow prepare add video component Week 2. Week 1, students gained access D2L navigated News portal. Here received Power Point slide package day's lesson audio lecture. While students signing class period sending questions (if any), Also Week 1, I practicing recording lessons analysis mastering (what I could) live delivery system, sharing PowerPoints, simulations, videos Week 2 delivery. AT time, I changes office home \"educational video studio\". The area needed quiet place away pets people, neutral background, comfortable classroom months averaging 3 classes day. (Don't forget coffee/water/etc. available.) After tries, I feeling confident Zoom sharing video components ready live Week 2. Week 2 challenges (not students synchronous, students handouts/observation lab sheets available, students needed \"handholding\", engaged. During time, I performed hours outside class dealing student's inability manage technology (connection speed, can't locate lesson/lab, simply attending class). I went recruiting campaign ask those, attending, return class. Prior request, I 50% attending, request, 80%. By end semester, 88% attending, remaining students dropped course. Week 3, course dynamics smoothed delivery felt face face. The students familiar delivery learning. I notice drop median test scores face-to-face delivery online lecture/testing +/- 10%, (median= 82% 75%) sections. I conclude case \"online student fatigue\" students taking online course opposed students taking one. I continued Week 2 approach final week course meetings. I recently completed semester happy decompress. I sure I reflect time discover revelations recollections clearer.You said 5-7 minutes, I've spent already. Sorry!Enough students issues home homeless I changed instruction equitable possible allow greatest chance success. Knowing lives essential choice human care plain learning info. I lowered content goals don’t mind all. In addition, I moved participation mindset (group work, upper division tutorials, social learning, research based tools) proficiency (but repeated attempts solving problems, revisions exams, etc). The point help eventually arrive right place help there. But half class turned thing exam final, meaning hw, life circumstances (no WiFi home, space work trailer, home, job requirements, depression, quarantine, etc.).Online instruction complete failure.Sharing experiences, ideas, discussions faculty list-serve email hugely active useful. All levels participated university.Prep-time extremely long compared person teaching.Students preferred asynchronous modules built mini lectures. But time consuming make.Used Live class presentations end term project. Worked I use future. Pressure produce “clean” takes tough. Every mis-step going watched over. I teaching flipped course years, switch online impact far preparatory videos, learning checks, homework. In class meetings students work groups and, person, undergraduate assistants I group group discuss material. We emulate Zoom breakout sessions. The limitations meant I functioned traffic cop, steering assistants individual group breakout rooms. I longer able devote time answering questions myself. We ran new separate section students Asian time zone. Fortunately, assistants time zone. Providing secure exam challenge. I wound Qualtrics, multiple choice questions delivered students random order allowing students previous question. Extra problems added student able back, (which bad meant students worry time management). Students taking exam simultaneously logged Zoom session mics (but video- intrusive).I eased edge course offering lots extra credit. The students appreciate it.In face-to-face instruction, I active learning techniques explored physics education research (PER). E.g., flipped classroom (in style Just-In-Time Teaching), Perusall textbook readings, tutorials group problems class time. Some unaltered switch online instruction (e.g., Perusall, flipped classroom). Some I continued using, face-to-face contact clear worked (e.g., tutorials, in-class practice problems).lab portion completely absent. No way person instruction-no way substitute. Physics musicwhich relied heavily ensemble playing/experience.I co-teaching first-year seminar Art History professor. Getting first-year students engage discussion \"scary\" topics like physics art difficult face-to-face, nearly impossible Zoom.I teaching 'flipped' 'active learning' introductory physics class aimed biology majors. This class zero lectures spends class time involved group work class discussions. We switched online kept usual activities Zoom breakout rooms class Zoom discussions. We modified instructor/LA interaction protocols group sizes. Overall tried maintain usual interactive class structure. Our attendance nearly full. Participation rate class harder judge. But final exam results scores disappointing: low scores, wide distribution lack score correlation prior scores students semester. Overall left broad concerns effectively students learned left campus. We concerned final assigned letter grades meaningful given circumstances. There evidence substantial cheating online administered exams, hard judge scope.Because I small class discussion based, transition fairly smooth. My students GroupMe class I encouraged use (more I normally would). A things I tried didn't work I liked - involved modifying plan lack equipment. Other modifications, peer evaluation, worked I include future regardless meeting structure.Side note: I heavily involved transition Introductory courses (both sequences) commented survey specifically asking I taught I transitioned.It horrible, spent way time trying prevent cheating exams, changing assignments multiple guess programming blackboard, answering emails. Cheating: method I seen prevent online cheating exams, bypassed creative mind.Multiple choice: I believe, takes away critical thinking skills, learning new material.Excess emails: students able face-to-face answer, students thinking I mind reader, multiple emails sent, students send information needed answer question.It went students happy. There definitely things I learned I differently, considering thrown unexpectedly middle term, went extremely well.The biggest problem online exam. I caught 130 students cheating online Discord exam (we prohibited collaboration short answer exam worth 40 100 points - rest exam students allowed collaborate on).I considered respondus, allowed require students webcams, recording students, respondus easy (just google \"how cheat respondus\"). For Fall, going online instruction. For introductory physics course, I idea produce exam accurately asses student performance ease cheating online, I spend inordinate time it.The hurdle I faced dealing labs. The components course I continued is. I pre-recorded prelectures prelecture quizzes students completed. This continued. For lecture I continued normal, delivered zoom. I zoom breakout rooms allow students discuss think-pair-share questions complete group work. Students voted zoom vote tool.Initially I emailed students tests required write answers include calculations scan tests return (I partial credit problem solutions).I soon discovered method feasible rampant cheating. Apparently solved problems virtually recent textbooks available online! In online course, I use Blackboard timed multiple choice qustions (hopefully) reduce cheating.I suspected transition occur. I colleagues research group started looking different ways deliver lectures tests on-line 3 weeks advance. We strategy week announcement. Then implement this.I primarily recorded posted lectures students watch. They required post question lecture discussion board, attached short assignments went w/ lecture. Students online HW week online lab. While I think worked OK, I miss student interaction face-to-face class ability judge students confused need additional instruction. I don't feel got simulation labs true hands-on lab.I peer instruction iclicker cloud software face-to-face lectures. Before transition, I following news closely asked students format prefer face-to-face meetings possible. They thought I joking, state's stay home order came days afterward. My preference asynchronous Khan Academy-style lectures students internet bandwidth participate missing anything, I people wanted synchronous lectures I middle ground. I record 15-minute mini-lecture post students watch asynchronously, meet synchronously half time before, peer instruction iclicker cloud software. Learning Zoom little stressful, I got figured I don't mind much. Feedback students positive. We finished semester way, we're 25% \"spring\" semester, remote start finish.Testing problematic large class. I way proctor online students. Cheating rampant. Also, I teach astronomy; labs difficult online. There options real-time observations telescopes online. You recreate experience night sky.lack prep time transition extra hard transit F2F onlone.I think 5-10% students university online learning. The rest self discipline learn physics online courses. My fellow faculty I saw class attendance online lectures drop 75% transition online learning. Also, 35-50% students simply stopped turning assignments taking tests. It hold hands in-person process learning, majority students school flounder. This true introductory physics courses upper level undergrad physics courses. Maybe it's different R1 schools, R3 school reclassified R2 2018, student body different. As aside, I worried transition upper level E&M class online learning spring horribly ineffective. At end semester I asked students COVID-19 response survey extra credit. Their responses indicated online course transition best university. I don't know pleased worried again.Because I regularly teach large classes, sections class 150 300 students, I online digital tools years. The main transition semester creation recorded video lectures asynchronous replacements of, supplements to, synchronous classes continued held. Planning, scripting, recording, re-recording I messed things up, organizing, posting embedded questions videos resulted like doubling tripling prep time lectures.Quizzes tests difficult. Although I tried things reduce cheating, questions tests ended Chegg. Because emergency nature past semester, I lot pursue academic misconduct.My style teaching lends on-line classes. My complaint Canvas Zoom changing. Using like shooting moving target.Prior COVID-19, I flipped classroom format instruction face-to-face classes. The technology tools provided university (Zoom) facilitated easy transition remote synchronous learning. The key features include breakout rooms built screen sharing whiteboard functions (with appropriate drawing device). In case, I open zoom meeting laptop, I control things participants breakout rooms. I join meeting iPad, combined high quality stylus, makes whiteboard work breeze.My experience transition face-to-face remote synchronous instruction pretty seamless. Furthermore, point current semester, student engagement performance comparable face-to-face classes.The biggest concerns department (1) incorporate laboratory type activities, (2) loss peer support structure upper division majors (our department dedicated majors room lot collaboration coursework positive socializing takes place).I started graphics tablet/computer projector lectures 5 years ago, knee injury, students better, lecture notes saved students 'note-taking' accommodations. Transitioning Zoom \"screen share\". I typically 3-5 research Zoom meetings week past years, it's familiar territory. The upper-level physics courses I teach strong component homework, Fall I lot work generating new homework problems main course I teach. I plan on, haven't yet, online exams.I lucky I small (11) class size. I familiar zoom I use research related matters, transition difficult. Certainly nervous large class.There advice choose (I consulted, once, enormous Twitter group faculty world, thousands incompatible suggestions). I great deal trouble getting technical questions answered (no help problems Apple, TopHat, textbook publisher, Zoom, YouTube). My at-home technical equipment minimal date (I work office) I fortunate faculty authorized come office Zoom sessions. Talking users far effective form help. I finally settled simple unsatisfactory method writing lecture notes screen-sharing I lectured synchronous classes, posting afterwards. Breaks TopHat quizzes ask questions produced interaction, class 29 join session. I converted exams take-home (never having 40 years teaching; unfortunate learning experience well). The experience profoundly disheartening, ineffective, resented students. My incompetence contributed; I virtually prior experience consumer electronics social media level, students contemptible. Whatever success I teaching career entirely based circumstances longer effect line. I took opportunity retire July 1, partly avoid teaching online fall. (Though I retired anyway, wavering eliminated prospect entire semester like weeks).My class 2nd semester calculus-based class. I believe important unit physics engineering majors course relationship electric potential field, completed spring break in-person instruction. We magnetic fields electromagnetic radiation online. Our instruction topics descriptive mathematically rigorous, I asynchronous interactive activities based PhET, Mastering Physics assignments, Khan Academy videos feel good it. But I things differently I entirely online fall.I moved pre-planned lectures chalkboard Zoom, digital whiteboard iPad place chalkboard. Overall method work, students trouble keeping pace classroom. They suggested providing notes afterward help relieve burden writing notes listening remotely. I noticed willing interact Zoom in-person, generally preferred use chat window speak loud.My colleagues emphatic posting online CSEM FMCE tests. They CSEM Hake gain reported twice usual. I ended FMCE online (due politics). However, I strongly oppose use FMCE Spring 2020 indicator anything.at I went asynchronous class I childcare. weeks I polled students learned wanted meet live so, 4 weeks met synchronously recorded it.I transitioned weekly online quizzes students frequent feedback.Overall, good experience.It went surprisingly well. I drop hands lab type activities, I substituted based simulation activities labs demonstrations. I planned field trip nearby NASA center cancelled. But transitioned fairly well, including watching movie, reading discussions, guest speakers, timed untimed tests.I'm sure survey capturing I'm trying tell it. I teaching online (fully) years prior Pandemic, business usual result. I suffered headaches, probably got students future courses it, increased preference students dean able meet changing needs quickly ably.I learned \"on fly\" realize I better preparation, iswhat I summer.In ability hands-on work difficulty collaborative (peer-instruction) activities definitely degraded quality class.Feedback harder gauge. Absenteeism bigger problem, I refuse attendance water class students taking course to, opposed wanting to.Starting Monday, March 16, instruction moved online format. We days transition online instructions. I chalk-board types learning new things wasn’t difficult. I web camera Blackboard. I write paper pad students computers. After lecture, student told felt “sitting watching write pad”. There questions format face-to-face instruction. I able di demos realtime able results screen, help camera. The closest \"online teaching” (felt like that) I lecturing 360 students UPII huge auditorium. I think overall went well. I missed seeing student faces though, provide valuable feedback lecture going. The labs real loss. Cant holograms polarization spatial filtering online. We convert remaining (fun) labs reports.I Kahn Academy style lecture style \"Explain Everything\" (and Ipad whiteboard app). I pre-recoded lectures, played synchronously lecture time, allowing questions interruptions. I later uploaded lecture Blackboard. I efficient, time-wise, I able cover material time. Preparing lectures took longer, though, \"perfect\".our university required classes meet synchronously ; remote, \"fully on-line\"The worst aspect rampant cheating (classmates & Google & Chegg) students.it upper level phys course, hands-on experimental modern physics course. general hands-on experimental lab near impossible teach online you're talking advanced experiments like cosmic ray muons, nmr, chaotic pendulums, optical tweezers, etc.Virtual instruction challenging teacher student, reasons. I tried change little possible, keeping syllabus meeting time virtual classes. Now, I working designing virtual environment interactive.1. I Canvas Poll Everywhere, online course management new (but time consuming).2. Miraculously, I taught course previously, I recorded lectures classroom lecture capture system. I able use videos making new ones, I live Zoom meetings I new examples. I uploaded videos Panopto integrated Poll Everywhere questions video paused students vote like classroom.3. The labs difficult adjustment. We zero videos ahead time, I frantically tried recordings apparati classes resumed. Learning Adobe Premiere Pro lot work, dealing large files difficult home. 4. I discovered online physics simulations, ones exist use approach me. I guess I need learn interactive simulations web.I held live lectures YouTube usual class times, utilizing OBS set streams. Students present Discord ask questions live, text channel voice channel. Physics labs converted purely digital format. I PhET The Physics Aviary, choosing labs let students \"measurements.\" I utilized BU simulations introducing concepts beginning lab activities. Students completed lab notebooks digitally submitted lab reports usual. Feedback positive.As time staff I given assistance guidelines updating class developed 10 yrs ago. I required teacher record taught classes online experience. It trial error detriment student semester. It bad I working MS Secondary Education parallel teaching.When technology works, fine usual anxiety process.When 10% technology components start failing middle class, anxiety skyrockets delivery plummets quality 50%. Smaller passing glitches technology (pause internet connection, echo zoom, strange voices background) increase blood pressure adrenaline, recover continue.It ok spring students knew I knew (same students fall spring). I teach class SCALE-UP style, lot in-class group work. I don't know year remote. I push hard community building - want know friends, afraid so.Because abruptness transition, I think experience probably representative...but I hated it. I’m professor I love working people help learn. I’ve spent literally decades Turning classrooms places hands-on, interactive, collaborative laboratories exploring content. I felt I throw away time think creatively dynamic online. Maybe I better end August, distinct classes prepare, I’m optimistic. That’s depressing.Live sessions extra awkward I face-to-face lectures I constantly engaging students discussions having work partners, etc. Live Zoom lectures produce that. If I choose live Zoom lectures, I definitely incorporate in-class polling, breakout rooms, encourage students join video, etc.I followed Khan format recorded notes. My students said liked content I producing. I think supplementing face-to-face online content way I teach going forward. It closest I successful model flipping class losing content.I offered lecture content pre-recorded videos. The video recording writing iPad screen talking it. I class time essentially office hours answering questions homework. Homework came form MasteringPhysics (something semester); pdfs problems solved, digitized, uploaded; lab reports uploaded Canvas. The lab content consisted recordings professor performing experiment providing appropriate data observations. The exam provided Canvas site pdf students 2 hours solve upload.Doc cam essential I didn't immediately. Synchronous participation fell sharply online transition.The online class simply standard face-to-face. The active learning techniques face-to-face classes translated poorly online implementation.The biggest problem I faced able meaningful assessments. We significant problem variety forms cheating examinations.I split person lecture combination peer instruction, class problem solving, face face lecture. I recorded lecture portion asynchronous viewing synchronous class meetings problem solving peer instruction. It wasn't great solution. Lots kinks work out. My math methods course synchronous usual. It difficult deliver effectively online derivations increased interaction majors. I fan moving class online, do.It easier I expected basic lecture class homework exams. The big problem labs.Having bad hand writing makes online teaching short notice difficultI taught online transition institution online teaching. It challenge me. However, I suddenly discovered number tools teach online. I utilized (mainly Zoom), I like practice experience tools. I think, useful run series webinars focused tools online teaching. For example, majority colleagues familiar Zoom Skype only. I challenges homework assignments tools replace blackboard classroom.I instructional faculty institution 21 years coordinator introductory sequence 20. I support LCMS, LON-CAPA, department. During transition role lead instructor technology support department, I didn't time research bunch ideas. The way forward short-term coverage clear, took time implement it. With summer going online, I 5 days end (after collapsing previous ordeal) pull current, condensed format (14 weeks 7) online class. To boot, week ago I received non-renewal (ie., year notice) instructional position budgetary issues existed Covid, exacerbated it. Not happy time.I 6 advanced graduate students. We moved lecture Zoom I continued hold office hours, moved Zoom. Everything else, including oral reports, same. I honor closed-book portion exam I don't think cheated. I lucky class semester. It easy. Also, I practice, I taught mode Fall recovery surgery.I slower online I repeated more. I believe harder gauge understood, I tell facial expressions/physical cues face face. I mistake initially requiring students participate cameras on.The lab portion class changed like thought experiments reasoning physics conducted zoom breakout rooms. The challenging aspect class conducting exams fair, prone cheating, overly burdensome anti-cheating measures.I typed lecture notes available ahead time, talked Zoom normal class time. Some derivations I worked paper showing document camera.For Spring I continued teaching synchronous lessons posting notes, recordings. I issues recording software live lectures trying record lectures post. Very frustrating time-consuming. I don't training methodology software/hardware associated video recording editing. I simulations labs adequate physics lab, students need hands-on training equipment face-to-face time instructors. Lecture notes substitute live lectures problem-solving sessions. The times I've tried record videos files large cumbersome glitch, mention I soundproofed, interuption-free place decent quality recordings. I like having students watch outside videos emphasize problem-solving strategies steps. And don't started online non-proctored exams plagiarism.Teaching STEM area difficult lab component making sure students engaged learning process. The hands-on experience labs extremely important students.I teach University Nevada graduate program atmospheric sciences (not physics se). There 8 enrolled graduate-level class cloud physics, asked email preferred zoom class appointed time receive audio files lectures week allowed listen anytime week convenient them. All student chose option, way. Regular homework assigned.The class aerosol cloud physics half aerosol physics, 2nd half cloud physics. I taught 2nd half cloud physics began beginning lockdown.My class common model, research methods class involves lot student writing, revision resubmission, presentations library research. students fortunately completed second inquiry. inquiry online survey project, final inquiry enhancement second inquiry, publically available data spread completion inquiry 2. students equipment needed home inquiry already.It disaster, support form institution minimal irrelevant. I learned lot online. I don't possible assessment meaningful way online course. Instead I think right model freely available MOOC, break material small segments gave exercises interactive problems segments. The student proceed mastered segment, \"grade\" getting end.However brings question way Universities funded tuition. It honest pay do, scholarship research teaching freetoo work worrying technical issues studentsexam cheating huge, viable method prevent italmost lab courses useless onlinestudents focused classwork onlineit view task disconnectedElectronic circuit simulation software transition remarkably smooth. New introductory material rewriting lab descriptions necessary. However, end value added students learned in-lab techniques half semester, simulation techniques second half.With days prepare, I don't think ideal time assess taught online. If online fall, lot time prepare institution giving courses help produce best possible online experience students.Zoom proved useful. I able, chat rooms, divide students groups basically follow interactive, studio-style approach little modification. Students responsive willing participate talk other. Tests modified reduce duration, I felt I complex problems basically open textbook ones :) . I lucky reduced teaching load semester activities Faculty Senate (I 6 hour reassigned time). Had I load, things daunting.Although online teaching time preparation beginning, preparation, course easier. However, online teaching leaves impression informal, difficult ensure progress students truly. Also, tests homework sets problematic perceived cheating. Another thing physics online teaching students feel uncomfortable learning way.From overall experience, classes perfect online (say, programming, skills courses etc) ok (like astronomy seminar like course) suck - lab based courses, including physics introElectronic resources testing assessment quantitative computational courses sciences abysmal.I teach guided inquiry format students working small groups. This maintained Zoom breakout rooms. Evidence support/refute student thinking provided videos experiments, students performing experiments themselves. The frustrating aspect normally class discussions come consensus harder significant participation online.I think went okay students -- course evaluations indicated students obviously missed campus course went well. Also, grades (homework, exams etc) stayed hte improved half hte course wasnt major loss learning. It lot stressful took lot time.I teaching summer school now, I trying implement strategies based lessons-learned Spring.Exams forced open book huge extra time.Nowhere near rigorous normal.Grading pass/fail. Hard seriously.My experience online teaching having students working groups strong encouragement students attend synchronous meetings.Most students attended synchronous classes, option synchronous asynchronous.horrible.It effective teaching person. Student engagement major problem. The University gave lip-service support faculty. Mainly, professors own.I lucky I prepared electronics lectures online circuit simulator, circuitlab. There instructor catch bit. I wish I zoom experience google meet, OBS, twitch youtube. I able share preparations instructor. We teach 2-3 online classes spring break. That helped. In addition, I epidemiological modeling state department health welfare. That bit distraction stressors kept busy worry things going on.Teaching Introductory Physics online highly NOT recommended. I spent 3 times time Webex face-to-face help understand Lenz Law, right-hand-rule, Brewster angle polarization... basic concepts. The impossibility think-pair-share, peer-to-peer instruction, student engaging techniques class traditional teaching style, I dislike it's inefficient. Interactive engagement imperative Physics teaching. Over Webex sessions, I tell students \"occupations\" paying attention class. Others signed \"really attending\". Other attend all. E.g. student dropped A-student COVID19 C-student level 5 weeks. The EXTRA time I (besides 6 hr. contact class time 2 hr. study session weekly) students level expectations. end I started keeping score: 3 weeks class I spent extra time follows, week#12: 12 hr 20 min; week#13: 3 hrs; week#14: 11 hr. The number emails I answered number GroupMe text messages I relied students engaged focused included above, burden unfortunate Physics online teaching. Not mention cheating can't controlled. With online teaching I guarantee quality assessment. Even Lockdown Browser Respondus proctoring system, grades higher expected... that's is.The format class studio physics, means A.) students spend time lecture days working problems groups, B.) groups labs integrated course material. The shutdown came spring break, meant I days figure remainder weeks left semester. The work groups I Zoom breakout rooms students group work shared whiteboards. I wrote online simulation based labs ones person, allowed students option submitting lab reports themselves, meeting normal class time (I estimated 1/4 students attended videoconference labs). Tests submitted online, I chose use strict proctoring like Honorlock. Grade results remaining exams different previous class semesters, cheating, fairly ineffective. Exams submitted marked Canvas' annotate feedback tool.Overall, students reasons simply attended class drop/withdraw, experience worked \"enough\". Not I choose do, work, students I worried (including accommodations) finish okay.We quarter system, biggest challenge thrown suddenly design perspective up. In addition, I sick COVID19 interquarter break, took couple weeks level bearing. I feel I lost lot contact students, it's harder support students struggling, I continually experiment I tools I expect to, level cheating high, simply time deal issues happening. On hand, students making use resources, new opportunities provide support exams, students turned better format self-paced learning.As graduate student, I wasn't particularly involved transition online teaching midway spring semester, I don't know faculty to. I end scanning lot documents PDF classes I teaching assistant, set Discord channel students class. I'm sure professor one, providing scanned notes. class I TA spring transitioned online blackboard pre-recorded lectures. The homework changed blackboard assignments/quizzes, labs moved online way providing students video photographs experimental apparatus use, measurements. From I heard didn't well, students struggled working own. This summer, I teaching introductory physics lecture courses. The class completely online. I'm Zoom lectures normal time class meet classroom campus, use screen sharing features use art program virtual whiteboard (I tablet, writing easy way). I record lectures post online case student misses lecture, I expect attend live possible. For homework, overall summer class enrollment relatively small, students working assigned problems hand uploading scanned work Blackboard turn in. The tools available grading work handed manner ideal, I prefer approach handling things like person class possible. I administered exam (the class ongoing) test Blackboard, questions essay questions students work typing in. This well, I probably explore ways students provide handwritten work going forward. I think labs summer courses following style end semester. The lab coordinator takes pictures video relevant measurements students expected use sort lab own. Labs Zoom sessions week lab instructors speak students help questions. We encountered issues photos information lab (provided folder google drive) organized well, working improving it. An unusual issue encountered lab lab coordinator color coding masses added hanger experiment, students need \"read\" total mass based colored tape mass. One student colorblind, method abandoned.Since semester I decided prepare person classes Power Point, delivering Tablet stylus allowed handwriting Power Point delivery, transition on-line pretty straightforward content. However, able students' faces lectures big minus and, students able ask questions, I've noticed participation line face face classes.A positive absolutely student joined on-line synchronous class, students miss face-to-face classes; impression happened way \"real life\" community COVID-19 crisis, i.e., impression case on-line classes regular times.limping along, improvising, testing insecureThe assessment graduate course I taught Spring 2020 project based turned easy transition online. Their presentations projects easily moved online Zoom. Collecting, grading, returning homework difficult end I eliminated it. Providing flexibility turned important students.I surprised initially, teaching effort working extent possible, assuaging, student anxiety overall global situation specific course situation. We spent week transition online talking expectations course format gory detail. I don't know I expecting that, expecting extent, given situation fall similar (uncertain students taught non-expert online teachers) I'd like able plan better.I difficult lecturing recording Zoom gauge students understanding weren't left uncertain assay online format. I usually use informal hand-raise style queries person didn't great substitute kind fly communication online lecture. I've tried PollEverywhere forever clunky unfriendly forever fighting students signed correctly, etc...I fortunate enrollments courses low (under 20) I knew students trust at-home paper tests honor system.I laugh list technologies I used. There time research options were! I desperately needed personal consultant technology recommendations answer questions technologies wouldn't do--and university provided consultant. Moreover, I didn't want impose stringent technical requirements students short notice. So I kept things low-tech possible, telling students read textbook type questions online discussions. I learned reading distasteful. They prefer watching videos!I fortunate regularly significant number online tools face-to-face course. These include LMS (Blackboard) - including Blackboard Collaborate \"Online Office Hours\", I've held evening option students many, years). I use online homework class (MyOpenMath). I repurposed build online class asynchronous learning modules week, complete built-in exercises/assessment. Further, I've personally taken half dozen online courses past year (all related instructional design multimedia design), I equipped course online (I glad I took courses - turned brilliant timing, hindsight)! Most faculty, however, went situation lot training experience me...I went fully asynchronous timezone time management issues (including stuck home kindergartener) biggest takeaway flexible convenient, I miss regular synchronous interaction students. For Fall, I plan continue significant asynchronous content incorporate synchronous aspects help maintain class learning community. My university intends face-to-face class time class based groupwork/active learning won't work socially-distanced classroom...I don't use Zoom, I shy/embarrassed/uncomfortable camera.I don't want use AV conferencing technology.I don't want use tech media primary means communication. It inefficient, frustrating, reduces learning, strains communication, doubles everyone's workloads.My anxiety greatly magnified I ASD GAD.I've similar experience transition online labs... students wrote evals need hands equipment understand it.Online learning works people replace live instruction.Go meeting person online \"last resort only\" strategy.FYI, online \"class\" I previously taught online astronomy lab. It's preformatted questionnaires students email questions.With regard 30-minute interview question survey, I explained, I uncomfortable camera. Perhaps phone email work better, but, given hesitation (rather willingness) contacted interview, I decline entering email field.Since I small (10 people) graduate class, good rapport students, transition easy me. My students kids meet regular class time, I recorded lessons case miss. I tried interaction transition online, virtual office hours, virtual student meet-ups/study-groups, lots opportunities answer questions ask questions lessons.My colleagues I met coffee days talk working not. I know faculty members struggled, I honestly think will, way teach fun engaging way.I note I extensively Canvas/Blackboard face-to-face classes transition remote learning, prepared materials neatly organized online I given electronic assignments before. For colleagues, new.Because lecture online, benefits arose. 1: Students campuses able listen. 2: Since Zoom record lectures, nearly entire lectures instant volume video lecture notes. The students colleagues enjoy them.Use zoom U-Tube videos!I changed little possible. I live video classes virtual whiteboard, recordings attend. Assignments unchanged labs virtually. Exams take-home, half class reported academic dishonesty.In general, onliine wasn't horrible initially anticipated. Zoom breakout sessions work reasonably ISLE approach I've predominantly activities needed modified slightly, form videotaping demos labs. There course issues, particularly time management adapting labs video format. Some worked enough, much. Also, students experienced tech problems, I time time. All said students tended involved online format. The pros outweigh cons mind I don't particularly look forward fall, looking like safe thing do. I don't want risk sake having drop coffee filter measurements video. Mostly I need prepare simply time, I try improve managing sessions productively try ideas making labs asynch.The transition difficult vulnerable students (i.e., non-white / non-male students).I miss face face classroom. You read people's faces. I feedback them. They me. Gestures, facial expressions way better I'm disembodied head.Speed responding emails key. Many students complimented quickly I able respond questions. This shows actually care students.Explaining physics email difficult. Taking extra time individual mathematical steps far easier students understand.The students I interviewed hate I. Just standoffish. Physics things work endeavor remote teaching denigrates experience. Only 1/3 students attend synchronous lecture use chat questions (very few)...so I assume rest class listens saved cloud recordings. Difficult time consuming save 1MB ~ 6 lectures. I spend ~15 hours week teaching way. We developed real on-line physics courses (took 2 years) past students hate also.After limited experience department colleagues' approaches online teaching spring term, I \"emerging belief\" synchronous meetings, despite concerns flexible and/or equitable, essential securing maintaining student engagement learning. I plan incorporate substantial synchronous component future online courses.My biggest concerns were:1) I aware large population students access computer. Many students working phones tablets. In cases, share device people.2) Many students job help families (delivering stuff supermarkets). With combined, impossible teach synchronous. As instructors, I believe crucial flexible restrictions.I teach face-to-face classes flipped model, I lots resources students. The transition students I smooth.I tablet+software recreated blackboard/whiteboard experience well. However, definite lack good software this! Students need bit encouraging stimulating class time focussed. Breaking things works well.(1) What survey include difficulties technology starting old laptop old operating shaky internet access affluent neighborhood end, students dialing Blackboard Collaborate phone, having spotty internet access, space work quietly.(2) Your questions focus modern technology. Besides slides PPT, nearly lectures paper old webcam showing I derived example I went through. Better fancy gaget (if I fix problems autofocus).(3) The main problem online teaching two-fold: It harder judge students' comprehension small-group breakout sessions, importantly performing equitable tests. The main challenge I summer teaching.online teaching lacks key aspects coursework including hands lab time face face interactions group work. Online teaching particularly lab courses far person lab experience IMHO busywork. I discussed TA's similarly frustrated unprecedented situation online teaching taken seriously students average.We teach guided-inquiry style simply moved Zoom Breakout rooms groups popped help/check-in group's progress. We videos experiments person provided LMS. We great discussions Zoom easy students turn video remain silent. We felt blind visual clues relied available Zoom. Teaching guided-inquiry style course on-line do-able need work hard getting level interaction person. Online assessment cheating hard. We large number students upload final exam questions Chegg caught. We hadn't realized real-time answers uploaded questions.The biggest challenge ensure students' participation active engagement. This somewhat issue teaching face face; students sat pay attention. During remote \"class\" 20% students log unknown paying attention. Only 10-20% asked questions. We asynchronous discussion/problem solving forums Canvas, 50% students participated regularly that, 10% all.I taught advanced grad class enrollment 6 students. We transitioned online way semester, expectations students place transition challenging. We MS Teams, recommendation institution, meet synchronously lecture. I files function upload updated syllabus, general project information. I chat window students answer fly questions, making sure write answer submit simultaneously reveal answers - little like clicker questions. Overall, learning gain semester little higher previous face-to-face delivery course. Statistically significant given size group.In Michigan governor announced closures forthcoming; week issued stay home orders. The day university announced following day online. Last minute changes like that, fully understandable, nightmare. I think going forward faculty backup, fully online lesson plan ready go. My greatest concern this, however, grade inflation lack ability person lab exercises.As aside: online education way, shape, form work. Khan Academy, youtube, etc. substitutes person instruction. Anyone thinks online education way future doesn't understand education lose job.Physics labs suffering online. I think area impacted most.Working professor's focused making best things smooth transitions. Working professor's focus making best things rough transitions.Since transition abrupt able department I missed demos usually carry explain better. I able cobble home ( I aim use class too). The thing I missed ' writing area / board space'.At I tried class identical F2F possible. That quickly fell apart I lot in-class collaborative work students working groups 2 3. The issue students struggle tech access (both computers wifi) time shifts work home pressures. Within week students went asynchronous watched Zoom recordings. I Canvas extensively add videos lecture demos provide links physics applets. In future I plan exams/quizzes directly tie applets. The biggest transition going lecture format student feedback Chat. I tried polling programs tech issues students having different systems disruption help, plus, students live anyway, polling (sort \"clicker style\" questions) somewhat pointless. The biggest misery exams. I'm certain cheating prevalent. On simplest level, exam averages went low 70s upper 80s. I spend extensive time rewriting exams simply Googled complete solutions.It isn't different face-to-face class. I rapidly got it. The biggest difference figuring use digital tools effectively. Some colleagues simply scribbled paper document camera, filmed chalkboard---boring. A digital whiteboard allows options help students engaged...graphics, slides, videos (did use), highlight pens, etc. Also Zoom polls.Previously I gave closed book exams proctored location (testing center). Now I giving online, open book exams students home. Test scores risen somewhat, I wonder class sufficiently challenging new teaching strategy.The disappointing aspect students' willingness cheat exams access groups like Chegg, OpenStax Google. We Turning Technologies exam polling software and, huge wave cheating 2 classes \"online\" exam, switch Canvas LMS Final Exam. Our results representative in-class results years previous, cheating possible.Even diligence preparing exams, department head teaching lower-level, 1-hour course required physics majors. In small course, 75% students course joined GroupMe shared \"wrong\" answers. (They didn't realize answers randomized!) The shared results easy track small class students given F course Academic Probation. It interesting leader cheating graduate Spring 2020 course offered year.I trying content students, I recorded lectures zoom help sessions Q&A. I Learning Catalytics online homework years I wasn't completely online experience tools.My class outlier, I little work transitioning. It discussion/presentation oriented class, grading participation presenations. The university transitioned online teaching spring break, 3 weeks classes left. We 2 guest lecturers series student presentations, adjustment.I bought iPad Apple Pencil allowed share screen Webex. The students observe helping solve physics problems.The transition emergency meet I improvised ways inquiry type class online. We videos I provided data. In fall likely taking class online again. I can’t ivy emergency improvisation fall semester.There challenges I faced rapid online:1. Getting student feedback in-class 2. Assessment strategies well-developed institution distance format3. Lack tools in-class4. Lack rapid feedback face-to-face provideSynchronous activities lot harder. Students focused, got them. But enjoy new asynchronous media.I enjoy teaching online. I think having student labs/activities home help understand physics. I like continue teaching online.When moved online Spring 2020, I know students took classes, therefore, order continuity discipline, I maintain schedule delivered lectures face-to-face classes I iClicker student response physics demonstration videos.I believe experience transitioning online fairly typical. I number blended instructional strategies face-to-face courses transitioned fairly well. The biggest issue I faced academic integrity students. The cheating I suspected prove took place makes wonder certification student mastery validity going online.We transitioned finals week (quarter schedule) spring break. I shifted final home got similar grade distribution compared I expected. I transitioned running studio sections larger course. I IOR course. That blessing I help best I worry myself.I'm happy interviewed, situation unique I don't know useful be.I usually use PowerPoint slides, document cameras, black board, clicker F2F lecture. When classes shifted online, I Zoom shared lecture slides. I pointed paper web camera wrote solve example problems extra information replace doc camera black board. Weekly assignments posted University Blackboard. Everything worked providing exams. Some students cheated exams. Entire final exam problems posted Chegg. Some students worked I saw couple exams exactly solutions/mistakes exam scores. Of course, exams NOT group exam. I exams harder situation. I 4 different version exams problems different numbers problem order changed.I feel OK classes. My knowledge subject matter saved obvious technological shortcomings. I think entire department good job. What worrisome decisions based \"this best do\" principle. No knows good THAT absolute scale. We know. No asking students feel able physics lab chemistry biology lab things come life \"their own\" data, graph it, interpret it, understand draw conclusions it. You room write. Thanks.People divided strongly camps synchronous vs. asynchronous interaction students. My opinion strongly asynchronous side, lecture materials; I think traditional lecture format translates poorly online/remote learning.For asynchronous teaching, I strongly believe dividing material smaller portions useful; lecture materials recorded 10-15 minute videos. At time, I believe important *some* synchronous component, e.g. real-time chat, Zoom office hours, live examples order interact students opportunity immediate feedback. The ability direct interaction students separate standard university remote classes MOOC model.For spring 2020 semester transition all-online, I I class planned advertised online partly-online class. For example, students hadn't signed online class, I didn't feel comfortable requiring webcam capability Zoom conferences proctoring online exams. I require fall students want exams online instead person.I teaching honors intro course 50 students. I number adaptations: I pre-recorded lectures extensive editing incorporate demonstrations, simulations, video quizzes place in-class iclickers. This took 8 hours work hour content -- way time I spending in-class version course, I taught multiple times. (I'm chair department, I chose teach class I teach lot new prep -- boy I wrong!) Although institution switched Pass/Fail students option \"uncover\" grades, I changed default grading rubric provide students options (weight pre-covid work higher, submit project place final exam, exam place project, etc.) I switched written homework in-class exams online versions administered Gradescope. At beginning, I polled students ask access technology, biggest concerns, etc. (Their biggest concerns were: staying motivated, integrity exams. Personal health safety far list.) I clear proceed flexibility, compassion, generosity. I think success, I hope it's experience repeat.The teaching I think fine. I concerns exams, I suspect students communicated etc.It challenge teach online I taught online course. Initially I stressed out. But online research having 4-5 days prepare powerpoints putting place, classes went well. Having touchscreen laptop biggest blessing. I bought stylus laptop I good go! In fact I believe lectures labs classes went I recording lectures zoom, students advantage watch missed lecture want review topic again.The lesson I learned surprised 21st century, technology based, I prepared online teaching. I feel like slap face:) I believe I ready teach online face face .I kept format fairly similar. Lots small group work, little bit class discussion. This format adaptable remote instruction, breakout rooms Zoom work fairly well.As experimental high-energy nuclear physicist, I feel challenges participating large international collaboration prepared transition online learning. I participating online meetings daily basis taught advanced graduate classes remotely I spend time laboratory.Though I little time ready online teaching, I lucky teaching small class. Still, I number mistakes hard fix made, inform teaching I again.My videos long, students incentive actually listen, I literally 2 days transition. Big fail school. There way ready days, especially I classes semester fly seat pants.I synchronous lecture Powerpoint WebEx allowed I able planned class student homework presentations, group work, in-class exams. I modify syllabus remove requirement student teams present homework problem class week, making homework grade entirely based written solutions. Lectures: I iPad share screen annotate slides include content I board like example problems derivations. The prepared slides mix blank slides titles slides content. The saved slides I posted students included annotations I posted WebEx recordings lectures Canvas students lacked reliable internet unable attend synchronously time zone differences. The main aspect lecture I missed face-to-face interaction I use facial expression body language cues gauge student understanding. Also, students hesitant ask questions class recorded I offered opportunity ask questions online survey advance lecture earn participation credit.Office Hours: I able project iPad screen WebEx online office hours \"write board\" students. Students sent messages/photos Telegram chat ask questions work, allowing solutions progressing. Course management grading: I gradescope extensively paperless submission homework grading transition straightforward. I Canvas online reading quizzes course management. Exams: The main challenge ensuring integrity exams. I allowed students pick format midterm exams chose 3 day home exam open note open book. The final format, self-imposed 3 hour time limit. I sure followed time limit requirement consult internet other, I saw direct evidence cheating.Student feedback: I offered opportunities anonymous feedback transition online. In general, students reported positive experience reported internet access issues prevented fully engaging synchronous lectures. The students completed end semester evaluation gave course overall 4.75/5 rating, acknowledge understood challenges I faced converting online likely lenient course planned online beginning. They recognized I bandwidth-limited I infant school age kids unexpectedly home.I teaching LA Pedagogy course (Physics Cognition Pedagogy); I director LA program, spent hours LA Program leadership working LA-supported courses transition online instruction, working faculty LAs practice strategies days spring break + online instruction. The support structure group dedicated colleagues working valuable.I vacillate bad I soon choose different career.So, main thing hard didn't hit I stuck home small children, I lot added child care responsibilities. This kind teaching hard.I planned teaching flipped-classroom assigned youTube videos prep work overall strategy didn't need change much. It took little bit figure Zoom breakout rooms facilitate small group work, got hang it. Everyone got better showing work annotate whiteboard functionality. The biggest change I making exams collaborative multiple days in-class.Parts turned better I expected. Most students showed group meetings Zoom, work turned appears similar past. The greatest loss sense I adequately communicating. The second greatest loss having students experience apparatus directly. I change focus lab away experiments stronger emphasis understanding experiments.Online teaching great, it, syncronous asyncronous. My students absolutely love it.I strongly appreciated sharing ideas workload colleague teaching course.By far biggest challenge pedagogical technological, psychological: A large fraction students taking calc-based intro physics course simply check transition online, entirely mostly. Attendance rates synchronous Zoom-based lab class tried (with breakout rooms lab groups) horrible. Attendance rates asynchronous, drop-in Zoom+Slack help sessions horrible. Assignment completion rates bad, students turn work merely going steps mechanically, looking easy points actually engaging. It's like shock.Word mouth department campus widespread phenomenon, limited intro lab course.Given speedy transition, team 3 faculty members (we coordinating), huge effort \"seamless\" transition online teaching. The aim similar dynamics face-to-face teaching. This somewhat successful. But clear correct strategy. Students learning remotely can't interact way studio classes. Though young students online interactions, distance (privacy). So, future online teaching course (on Fall), require restructuring teaching uses systematically online tools interaction. We employed example LON-CAPA platform gives good real-time feedback exercises. That's good example things work, I think.I transcribe notes scan them, order post students. This requirement took time I expected. I substantially modify presentation slides, I able actively use board screen in-depth analysis. It possible gauge level understanding audience, I observe group. For graduate classes, video-conferencing effective, lectures dynamic interactions students me, possible creating audio chaos.'-Made aware differences (pros/cons) online face-to-face teaching. I feel best path forward teaching integrate forms instruction- expectation that, form instruction fail (maybe subset students learn better online FTF), structure course retains integrity learning goals achieved.-Made question explore exactly brick mortar institution students & community-Made realize brick mortar institution requires students advanced functions - research, services, athletics, community engagement.My university serves region rural Appalachia commuter student base, 20% live campus 30% live neighborhoods campus rest live surrounding rural mountainous areas. The issue arise students access internet connectivity. My courses publishers website homework party polling app, work fine students access campus wifi. Once dispersed guarantee safely access reliable internet required times. I abandon polling app, I couldn't penalize students internet. Average attendance went 70-80% 10-20% synchronous lectures. Only student contacted zoom \"office-hours\" general interaction student approached zero. This approach entirely defeats point paying university education students end watching videos answering questions text. I understand frustration colleagues teaching online courses teaching upper level courses students took prerequisites online. Like us, I noticed scores online midterm better in-class midterm. However scores final conceptual assessment worse expected, compared online midterm grades. Suggesting mode learning wasn't actually improving understanding. Many colleagues university issues cheating Chegg platform, question validity online grades.Chegg devil. I'm finding nearly impossible administer tests fairly. Too restrictions, I disadvantage students. Too restrictions, students commit academic integrity violations.I Zoom web cam teach smaller intro physics course synchronously living room usual meeting times. My students loved appreciated preserving normalcy course routine.I learned takes longer. Every tool add video lecture takes lecture time use. Students stressed easily distracted roommates family. They feel takes longer grasp concepts. Students complain learning environment non-learning (fun) environment dissonance feel this. I learned risk students risk remote learning. Students kinds ADHD struggle structure coming class. I learned communicate open lines communication (even gave cell phone number text). I learned work partners class work.Columbia handled transition online teaching reasonably well. Classes cancelled March 9-10 faculty prepare teach online 3 days Spring Break. Zoom sessions booked automatically regularly scheduled classes accounts set instructors.I thought went fine students, course lot prep end recording lectures. I worried I following things I've heard best practice field. (For example, asynchronous recordings lot longer ~10 minutes)I think ways, online version course better face-to-face version, ways worse. It difficult students interact synchronous meeting times. I think partially technology (some don't dependable internet, ability write digital pen), cultural (they typically use internet passive consumption information). I having issue preventing cheating homework exams, that's easier prevent face-to-face setting. I like lots demo experiments time play allow students interact them. I've come home demos, nearly much. That said, forced videos lecture-part class, in-class time this. I available asynchronously use normal meeting times work homework problems tutorials. The biggest issue students don't know students better engage discuss online - it's difficult monitor progress zoom rooms organically switch forth small large group discussions.Typically, class fairly interactive, I reasonable grasp confused students feel (not confused are) person, I wasn’t able adequate replacements time allotted semester. The chief problem significant cheating exams, particularly back, use Respondus, problems help. I practiced lecture portion extended spring break worked mandatory post -lecture feedback mechanism. It inadequate better replacing in-class participation.The main issue *not* switch online teaching, switch teaching 1 4 year old home. My wife physics professor, higher teaching load semester. I didn't luxury \"worrying\" teaching trying \"great job\" teaching online. I didn't answer survey, I *still* time critical things. But I wanted respond I suspect statistically people position responses from.(to question: thanks--I haven't 30 minutes started!)I taught semi-traditional lecture, screen-share I showed slides hand-wrote notes tablet. The hardest getting student participation; breakout sessions unwieldy students reluctant speak face-to-face instruction.In future I think I pre-recorded short lectures students watch, run class open problem solving session breakout groups.I reduced expectations student-focused. Office hours zoom important.The class I teach physics lab. So went online challenging change entire plan rest semester figure online activities. Most activities given lab manager I forward students. Some students hard time software caused delays extra work.It VERY stressful week, changing exams written online multiple choice stressful. But I great help smart grader, learned taught randomize question order groups questions value. That appears worked, kept students cheating taking final exam remotely.Only class worry pre-existing teaching release, small upper-level E&M course. Probably easiest class course shift online, small number cluefull motivated students. Disruptions larger big service courses department's workload. So, I'm hte best person talk this.Transition online rapid time strategize debug launch. Very stressful.I prepare lecture notes contained details I explain blackboard. That took time I normally ask students read different textbooks cover material.I feedback students comprehended material. One simply replace information gets looks students class.I taught upper division E&M transitioned Zoom spring break (late March). We breakout rooms having students work small groups person. In nominal 80-minute class typically 20 - 30 minutes activities. In ways, students interacted breakout rooms. Of course, group hear groups saying other, hear conversations me. That downside. The problem shutdown students work outside class, meeting informally atrium \"Student Learning Center\" (just room desks, chairs, coffee pot). It *seems* of. online.I little bit preparation students Covid19 happened I saw coming advance. I changed brief in-class lectures short youtube videos. The rest class coding-focused, I able online. The big challenge student engagement. I dropped attendance requirement students able attend time, meant I didn't students more. I solution that.I didn't feel difference delivery method I taught synchronous classes. I missed looking students face adjust teaching dynamically I to. I feel sad students I lost personal office hours shared personal stories feeling belonging. I tried hard recreate online worked partially.Largest challenge time. My spouse worked full-time young children (one severe autism) home child-care. It required taking care children day weekends. Synchronous hours fortunately discouraged university impossible.Next largest challenge \"happy aren't well\" emails senior administration understanding different experience parents young children.My class typical, high-content physics class, shepherding 22 students experience writing physics research. The transition online easier fact students well-established cohort class met face-to-face 2 terms prior. I concerned class year, I establish cohort remotely. The hardest engaging 25 blocks screen - students turn video conserve bandwidth. I like breakout room feature Zoom. (The students well). It gets discussion going.I classes lab. My large class I pre-recorded lectures, small, upper-level class met synchronously lab adapted remaining labs PhETs. I concerned test integrity large classes. Apparently departments university rampant cheating. I suspicious incidents nailed on, I missed it, real concern. We preparing lab kits order students real experiments Fall.It exciting try run labs online. The result student writing analysis poorer.I unhappy exams. I believe cheating. Some students turned exams hours days late.On-line teaching presents inherent communication deficiencies.I assigned on-line lectures I don't think students them. The on-line sessions turned problem solving sessions, students enjoyed. I iPad stylus writing Zoom.Used online teaching, course. Seriously missed direct contact, meeting class room, face-to-face interaction.I work harder class engaged.Delivery content issue, available existing online resources good production quality choose from. The issue department adequately address academic dishonesty taking exams/quizzes/tests, etc. In STEM fields physics, multiple online resources extensive banks sample problems, making designing truly original assessments particularly difficult.I think online classes enormously effective large enrollments student-to-instructor contact barely existent face-to-face setting. Better record lectures all, students accessing time, recitations small classes, offer office hours. The case graduate instruction different, preferable case face-to-face interactions beneficial.In event rethink inefficient routine going class notes repeating year stuff. Consider address large audience online courses, extremely important person 10,000 world scientific education.Another advantage online classes people disabilities, instructors students, participate teaching learning process easier setting. I envision example brilliant instructor wheelchair continue work major issue, impossible traditional approach. Same course students. It worth point enormous reduction CO2 emission classes taught home, reducing zero commuting time allowing time research, teaching, free time, family.The hardest assessing student engagement.In thinking likely online delivery content fall, biggest challenge engaging students content posted LMS (Canvas case). Analytics spring semester showed roughly 1/3 students regularly viewed content. At present, plan embed reading content video lectures (in manageable, short clips) LMS quizzes students prompted answer questions content along. Also, online tests Respondus Monitor improved use wired WebCams view student's workspace viewing student's face exclusively. I hope able require fall.I absolutely hate it. Having face face contact important learning physics. It's history I need read faces tell students getting it.I tried approach learning expectations order reduce disruption. I didn't anticipate large disruption actually students terms patterns pacing class. Over weeks online spring I got intentional arranging deadlines pace work. I thought giving time helpful wasn't meant things time. Finding pattern lectures & associated \"in-class\" work, labs, homework regular spread deadlines important. I extended deadlines I students request extensions individually tell going on. I granted reason, I think felt lot better tell communicate struggles. This different circumstance course online beginning. Many lessons sudden unanticipated transition student stress online teaching.I class people, addition online lectures I sent individual mails assignments, andgave unlimited resubmission opportuities. About 2/3 students took advantage this, worked outwell took lots time. About 1/3 students fell behind. I don't know theywere distracted stuff going on, taking advantage free pass/fail options ouruniversity offered.I delivered lectures synchronously, I recording lectures students later time. I tracked students use recording, lot! I expect this. I guess helpful homework, students solve similar problems.I teaching face-to-face asynchronous online class Jan-April session. Obviously impact asynchronous online class minimal. I'm teaching flipped hybrid currently.Learning write Wacom tablet took time figuring software use writing sketching, recording. Adjusting labs bit difficult. I incorporated taking pictures short movie clips performing lab experiments.Normally, I observe students reaction, adjust speed accordingly, repeat difficult derivations different way. All work online setting: teaching feels like talking room. Also, I necessary write distribute lecture notes. Some students appreciated effort, takes lot time.Preparing classes online time-consuming instructor teaching person. Having good video recording software makes things easier.I difficult gauge students knew solve problems. Very advantage virtual office hours Blackboard Collaborate Ultra.I recorded audio giving lecture provided mp3 pdf notes students. Students pleased didn't stream class download huge video file. Internet speed major issue students well. I fine teaching online technology, etc. I hate compared person teaching.I moved conducting lectures synchronously online classes, different another, required different strategies. For 64-student gen-ed, I powerpoint Zoom, encouraged students ask questions chat. I TAs available supervise team-based activities week breakout rooms. For breakout rooms, I tried having supergroups 1 TA/room multiple teams room, work. I shifted 1 team breakout room, TAs moving subset rooms check students. There numerous challenges, mainly students able modified lab-like activities homes - some, possible. I tried sure person team activity, discuss team. My remaining exam open-book, timed delivered online system. Problems grouped topic. Once opened set problems, submit fixed time interval. However, exam available 24 hours. Instead final, I paper online presentations.For upper-level physics class, 18 students, challenging run traditional lecture. I began handwriting uploading notes I went Zoom - students hated this, went fast them. I tried purely writing OneNote - slow. The compromise handwrite upload scanned notes class, annotate OneNote. This worked better, hard students stay focused. Going forward, I intersperse lecture short problems do, learning active. I modified exam take-home, open book, completed 48 hours.What I took away experience, novice online instructor, comfortable technology, class needs tailored student learning outcomes minimally affected, like be.I actually possible engage students active questions lecture - maybe easily in-person lectures. Somehow students feel intimidated online.Much course LMS. For course transitioned, details getting synchronous videoconferencing deploying exams online.I I needed develop strategies combating student fatigue loss interest.I completely typed lectured years now, transitioning problem.The difficult aspect teaching online zoom, case spring (only 8 graduate students), students' feedback class. Interactive teaching I like, nearly impossible class spring. I difficult able write blackboard (e.g., deriving equations, ...). We learning better fall I believe difficulties largely removed fall case online teaching fall.The main difficulty widespread cheating online exams aided cheating company CheggI got pretty overwhelmed information suggestions coming out, especially same, I Blackboard sure worked. Homework grading online, purely electronic administration quizzes exams bumps startup.I delivered online exams, consisted entirely multiple-choice questions, randomized order. I transition quickly, didn't time learn best practices online exams. I generally different format in-class exams. Averages online exams extraordinarily high (e.g. 90% more, in-class exams typically close 70% average). I discovered exam questions Chegg.com, I'm sure rampant cheating, time methods truly figure cheating. Any solutions issue vital future \"online\" course offerings.I lots learn \"Zooming\" class students ask questions lecture--which I miss. I believe consistent meeting time makes easier all.I large 4 6 foot white board brought house lectured normal zoom. The students submitted homework pdf's email. Similarly home exams. Student interaction good. They frequently asked questions lectures. I frequently asked students going compared approaches said happy lectures. My concern I totally happy lighting.The short notice big problem. Its lab+lecture course grade associated lab exams. The course Observational Astronomy lab entails telescopes, difficult suitable virtual substitutes. The biggest problem online course I perceive it, giving exams meaningful homework lab grades, impossible insure independent work.It turned online teaching (my upper-level grad course 10ish students) easy.Did Powerpoint instead real-time solutions problems.The greatest difficulty assessing students' understanding lectures, students kept cameras turned off, picture hidden screen.Preparing teaching online stressful time-consuming previous teaching face-to-face classes.I hard students involved on-line class check participate time mute camera microphone entire class sessionI transitioned advanced lab (senior physics majors) class online. It completely different, worked great. I got include machine learning analysis ATLAS LIGO open datasets curriculum.Our university equipped transition.Keep continuous contact students stay tuned feel they're alone.Evaluating homework take-home exams difficult. I students email assignments form wanted use. Then I use clumsy text editors comments number grades work.The biggest mistake I think trying require synchronous activities (giving students ability request excused, necessary). We initially persuaded arguments colleagues lot students able synchronous classes, hoped lot students labs Friday group work, (less 10%) did. So students activities self-organized groups. This intro physics course life science students, students motivated engineering students, group work. So big questions require, given disparate circumstances. Our biggest concern going forward fall Chegg cheat exams. This happened intro courses. Exams biggest technical challenge: long window give? deliver questions? students upload answers?Generally, didn't reorganize/rethink course big way, Zoom carry usual, breakout rooms group work. A lot work learning details Zoom recording lectures. We started use Gradescope semester, turned lucky decision.The challenging problem giving exams online. Cheating big issue.The transition online instruction relatively straightforward spring term, I given midterm arranged final project lieu final. I concerned fall, asked prepare person online instruction simultaneously.I basically took in-person lecture lectured Zoom iPad. These lectures given synchronously regular lecture time. However, recorded. The recorded lectures pdfs lecture notes uploaded online available asynchronously students. Homework usual time, given weekly. The difficulty homework decrease, I started adding extra credit points. The 2nd Midterm Final Exam changed in-person exams home exams. Hence, students time complete them. The homework exams posted Blackboard, students asked upload solutions Blackboard (although allowed email solutions worked better.) Then graded homework/exams posted Blackboard.I like comment synchronous vs. asynchronous. We strong push institution asynchronous accessibility issues. While accessibility major concern, possible solve problem synchronous asynchronous. Dropping synchronous lectures fundamentally misunderstands students. This reason I didn't like teaching centers, I felt understand needs students weren't listening faculty. Just like faculty sign teaching online courses, students sign online courses it's likely took online courses before. Going purely asynchronous gigantic disruption learning, getting kicked campus. There lives centered rhythms campus taken away. It responsibility faculty semblance normality possible, help schedules. Additionally, students having set schedules expect time kicked campus, economy cratered, global pandemic puts undo burden students.So I learned: Try things normal possible, seemless transition possible. Do use huge new technology students learn. Set expectations communicate early. Also, regularly communicate reminding homework/lectures telling care themselves. Everybody understood ideal circumstance, I students responded fantastically showed understand care little. Finally, increase decrease expectations course, avenues improve grades. I like note end I passed everybody work. A note questions: One questions asked helpful different software teaching. I answered \"very helpful\" them. I like note Blackboard generally helpful face-to-face, like Zoom useful online teaching. Also, question characterizing Blackboard \"new\" I bit experience it, \"new.\"I learned use Zoom online quizzes Canvas. Other online components (homework, lab assignments) implemented face-to-face class transition onine teaching.I familiar Blackboard before, I problem adopting quickly. In addition, I complete training Math-Education helped adjust lesson-plan quickly need basis COVID-19 policy came force.Student feedback (questions, comments) nearly non-responsive. They reluctant ask questions, especially I record session (which requested). They stop interrupt ask questions. I know paying attention? I video going ruins bandwidth occasion I recording, session breaks, difficult piece videos together, disruptive flow class. The fear bandwidth problems led avoid video, I students reactions I teach. It basically lecturing black hole.I teaching smaller class, I thought reasonable continue trying meet synchronously students, allow continued \"in-class\" discussion (I recorded students needed miss class/had connection issues, etc.). I previously comfortable talking presenting Zoom, challenge fining ways rebalance activities/evaluations. While class went ok, definitely lacked good discussions allowed class, aspects evaluation challenging. I fortunate glad happened course, intro Physics+lab courses I teach, though!I team-taught IPLS course included lab component. We Zoom lectures lab. For labs, recorded videos photos procedures tried provide decision points students possible maintain authentic lab experience; worked well. We Gradescope MasteringPhysics online assesements, worked technically, students took advantage circumstances cheat - record number Honor Code violations.It hope fucking dump grades entirely transition educational system, credentialing system. I know, I dream big, there's little hope happen.Is US universities?I New York University Abu Dhabi, UAE.My university provided tools online help I needed. The transition Zoom fairly smooth. But I teaching lab course - problematic.I WebAssign iClickers, biggest day-to-day change I switching Zoom lectures. For reason, transition went smoothly I anticipated. Exams bit challenge. I use Respondus similar concerns students’ internet connectivity, I concerns academic integrity exams. Scores noticeably higher “virtual” exams.not pleasant, colloboration department, clear guidanceA major disadvantage quality ability use empathetic involvement.Like people, I feel like thrown it.A people better prepared recorded lectures backup efforts things on-line short teaching assistants, effort homework self-guided.... Most us, I thrown cold turkeyI nearly assignments submitted graded online, posting class notes course website prior transitioning face-to-face class meetings online (I synchronous class meeting I held zoom, posted alternatives students participate somewhat asynchronously needed to). Based class poll results, students prior experience video conferencing services like Zoom, however, I in-class primer prior official online transition. I got lot positive feedback students this, possible I relied solely official university-wide communications transitioning going occur not. I mention I lot 'dependents' professionally (e.g. research staff students, etc.) personally- online transition, prior experience research settings, extremely stressful result, I essentially halt research activities (even research computational nature remotely research group). I estimate I 1, 18-hour work day addition standard workload 2 months addressing student emergencies (or referring appropriate campus office contact). Many caused major access issues able function online class lack high speed internet access, getting locked LMS long periods time, lack access electronic devices like laptops (so access smartphones turning work, accessing class website, etc.), major upheaval life events like job loss, seriously ill family members, case eviction stay-at-home order. So super important incorporate inclusive methods online course design implementation! As instructor, I feel particularly supported department experience, I sought support online (sometimes starting twitter) reading blogs, etc.I miss able demonstrations, especially student participation. Videos same.Otherwise, technical stuff learned, OK. Office hours actually better.Because seminar 10 students, easy transition. We completely drop group projects impossible remotely. Because class working closely small groups disbanded, knew well, I think went fine. For larger traditional content classes, I think important thing form small groups study groups form contracts contribute responsible help learn. For group projects, disbanding, students rubric/checklist evaluate group members 4 points semester. I think good thing implement study group lab team, sure learning community remote.My comment interviewing I couldn't add below: I'd happy discuss teaching (I LOVE talking teaching), don't know helpful seminar class challenging online.This online teaching...Our institution called remote. It performed real time, transition short notice, preparation poor. I able sufficient information remote, real time delivery instructional materials (again, online teaching!) I tried best given conditions. Trial error works! The biggest challenge lack technological resources students (computer, internet access, bandwidth, accessories, etc). I included specific questions remote experience class evaluations; bad I expected, I think I better prepared I teach remotely near future.Although relatively straightforward transition lectures assignments online, I lost group/peer instruction aspect comfortable implementing online tools.Teaching online exhausting demoralizing. It takes time run class online, geographic circadian freedom async online class allows substantial, I don't want long-term. I think learning online live in-person standard, particularly student-student student-faculty communication limited clunky. I worry MBA Spring 2020 existence proof teaching online society (and universities) drain way uber decimated taxi industry airb&b decimated real estate markets.Worked hard. Did feel guided college.College statements cheating FERPA concerns faculty observing students.1. Should simulation software rigorously.2. I completely rewrite lab manual half content (The online content)3. Should kept attendance graded item. (It removed graded item remote instruction)4. I obtained good success online rework. I able engage students content face face content.5. Students adapted online experience.6. Students lose physical context real devices constructing real circuits. How great loss unclear right now.Actually, possible (it seemed) transition SCALE-UP class online virtual environment Zoom trouble. Students able use breakout rooms group work, Zoom offers polling capability enable clicker questions. Students able capture share group work whiteboard activities, able annotate questions figures displayed instructor. While I saying matched in-class experience, bad approximation.I coordinate engineering physics sequence. We cases suspect cheating final exam. That thing makes proud method labor intensive. We different fall tests I don't know is. The university encouraged flexible students internet good home challenges - meant eliminated attendance requirement synchronous attendance. A large percentage team posted pre-recorded (by else) videos content students watch hosted \"class time\" person. Attendance tiny. Students disengaged. Homework scores dropped. Faculty discouraged having talk impersonal \"black boxes\" screen didn't student photos! And, class typical attendance 100 - 40 attend live sessions. My personal live sessions 10 students. We want focus flipping classroom fall intentional breakout rooms student engagement lectures. We component course \"synchronous\" small group work sessions led TAs. We doubled TAs Zoom whiteboard annotate feature. We unlikely staffing maintain fall. For spring - continued WebAssign. Ramped Moodle share videos testing. Right - summer - I testing Gradescope Respondus monitor proposal faculty testing plans fall month.I 8 sessions left went online. We muddled 8 session together.Since I 250 students, sizable percentage timezones, I opted asynchronous class mode I pre-recorded lectures. I extra-credit quiz lecture motivate students watch time. I held active discussion sessions variety times students turn work end. One biggest challenges dealing online examinations associated complications. I think biggest challenges students adjusting online mode finding calm discipline needed succeed class home. I ended abnormally wide distribution grades.The challenges online labs cheating exams. No fail-safe solution cheating. Chegg worst offender.If teaching online again, I'd prefer students simply watch well-curated video lectures exist, I use zoom solve problems discuss concepts students. I don't know yet; I don't know well-curated lectures I point students to. I look appears I teaching online Fall semester.\n"
