Q37
"We are interested in how your experiences in Fall 2020 differed from the Spring of 2020 with teaching your physics class online. Feel free to describe anything you learned for Fall 2020 about transitioning the class, any lessons you have learned and anything you think we should understand."
I had to work harder on making social connections with students.
"I usually teach face-to-face SCALE-UP.  So one of my primary goals was to have students do as many (virtual) lab exercises as possible.  So I adopted iOLab, Pivot Interactives and PhET simulations.  I'll bring a lot of that back to my face-to-face classrooms to supplement the labs I usually do.  I also broke my 63-student class into quarters and had each quarter work with a single one of my assistant instructors (three graduate TA's and one undergraduate learning assistant) for the entire semester in an attempt to build relationships between students and assistant instructors.  I will also bring that strategy back into my face-to-face classroom."
Our institution pivoted to 100% online in one week in March 2020.  I was very impressed with my colleagues and learned a lot from them.  I used what I learned in the spring semester to comfortably teach online in the fall.
"I could plan ahead for online teaching, so I could address the shortcomings of this teaching mode by shifting learning modes and expectations. "
Students need time to interact with each other. The more you get out of the way the better. It needs to be forced at least in the beginning.
"In face to face teaching, my course used active learning where students would work together, in fairly close proximity to solve and present problems (so that they could explain their work to their peers).  Inevitably in face-to-face there would be cross-talk between student groups at the same table.  In teaching online I used Zoom breakout rooms which are completely separate, which killed all of that useful eavesdropping.  Student engagement was uneven to say the least, some students just wouldn't interact or unmute, and it was impossible for me as the instructor to assist unless groups asked for help.  Some groups wouldn't work together at all, and left before the end of class or completing the in-class work.  For substituting for their in class presentations, each group had to film a video of them going through their solution, which was a ton more grading.  There was a lab component for this course which was done with iOlab devices augmented with some simulations.  I made that asynchronous and every single issue of using computer data acquisition that we would have had in class, we had with individuals.  Comparing learning gains from a year ago (100% face-to-face) to this fall (100% virtual) showed a decrease in learning gains, though not a huge margin.  This might have been easier with a far smaller class, even though I had the assistance of 3 TAs and an LA, there were still 13 groups of 4-5 students."
"Most of my teaching strategies were gauged for in-person and real-time feedback about student learning, mainly through in-class questions with Learning Catalytics. In the COVID-19 times, asynchronous learning must always be an option. That shifted much of my strategy and only about 1/3 to 1/2 of the class was interested in engaging synchronously with the course material."
"My class is an active learning, group work based class - there are no lectures. Instructors and undergrad learning assistants work with small groups on activities followed by entire class discussions. We moved the in person version of this online using Zoom and break out rooms. We mostly kept the same activities and content, but overall went slower and had to cut here and there.

1) We observed far more heterogeneity of student situations and ability to participate effectively. 
2) Our students are missing technology that could help greatly with online synchronous group work - tablet + stylus gear. The students with that gear seemed to participate much better.
3) Our final exam scores for both spring and fall did NOT correlate as expected with semester performance or other grades. The value of the exams was questionable.
4) While we assigned regular grades, I wonder what they mean compared to usual. I don't think they carry the meaning the usually do.
5) Everything online was slower than in person - more friction. All progress was slower. 
6) Lab components were very difficult to implement online.
7) While student attendance was high, participation was much lower than usual. "
"I applied many of the things we as a department learned from Spring 2020 to my fall 2020 courses. We were able to leverage a large number of things and shared new ideas amongst those of us teaching the same courses. When one of us would learn how to do something new, we shared it with others in the department."
"In the Fall I was teaching an introductory lab-based course that is normally taught ""studio-style.""  There was a huge adjustment trying to encourage active learning via Zoom."
We already had a premade video of the labs to be used. We also offered an online only version of the lab however much improvement is needed for that. I believe we need to provide students the necessary materials to do a lab at home and also give better instructions that are more clear. 
"I taught several introductory physics mechanics labs online in the fall.  The biggest problem I found was that several students obviously doctored their results to match expectations.  I don't know a good way to stop such cheating, or what to do about it when I suspect it.   "
"Instead of exams, I either have group projects or have the students make YouTube videos explaining solutions to problems, derivations or concepts to peers at other institutions. It works better to gauge understanding if they can explain solutions rather than writing them down in a timed format."
"Spring 2020 was spent in triage mode - trying out small variations till something worked reasonably well. Since then, Zoom has added features, and I have had the opportunity to learn from others how to engage students better. While most of the students were very happy with the level of engagement in Fall 2020, it still remains a challenge for some. It is hard to figure out how to modify in-class activities without spending excessive time on everything associated with running - everyone is tired of the excess amount of time everything takes. Finding the right balance between activities to check-in with students during synchronous sessions and having time for instruction without expecting them to spend excessive time to prep outside of class - findign this balance is the challenge most instructors face."
I had to rely totally on Zoom.
"* Note: After designing a fully online series I‚Äôve came to the conclusion that almost everything on this list is just as relevant to your face-to-face (f2f) classes. I did not add a number of things, like backward design or the importance of metacognition, which I think would be considered already a best practice in f2f classes. If I added something like that here, I tried to highlight what about that practice is implemented different or more important in the online setting. 



Effective Practices

1.	Flexibility
a.	Due dates
i.	Not only an assignment here or there but even for systemic changes for individual students. A student may be in the field for multiple weeks, unable to engage at all, but when they return they can focus more intensely. 
b.	Engagement modes
i.	I cover this more in the section Multi-mode learning
c.	Assessment ‚Äì Providing a number of ways to engage also means providing a number of ways to assess. Some students may be able to make synchronous group meetings or lectures while others are not. Allowing them the ability to engage and be assessed in multiple different modes ensures the flexibility required for distance learners.  
i.	Participation
ii.	Labs
iii.	Homework
iv.	Exam types
v.	Exam delivery methods
d.	Cheating ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt know exactly where to put this but since increased flexibility can result in more opportunities to cheat, I put it here. 
i.	Most students are opportunistic cheaters, meaning they set out to cheat, they just found an opportunity to do so that is easy. Small policies and practices can go a long way to prevent the majority of students cheating. 
1.	Have students sign an honor code for every high/mid stakes event. Make them read it each time by planting a unique statement that must recall before signing. 
2.	Consider removing all high-stakes events. The reward has to outweigh the risk.
a.	It‚Äôs also much hard to systemically cheat many smaller events (quizzes or exams). 
3.	Consider using physical proctoring centers. This is the most secure but may create additional cost for the students and extra organizational work. 
4.	Consider online proctors like ProctorU. There is a gradient of security. On one end you have systems simply recoding their cams for you to watch later. On the other end the system completely takes over the student‚Äôs computer and there must be multiple cameras connected. A human may be watching live. These services can be just as costly as physical proctoring centers. 

2.	Multi-mode learning opportunities (maybe this belongs under flexibility)
a.	Synchronous ‚Äì PER supports a number of models that all include some form of guided peer learning. Students work in groups with instructional staff available to guide the work and discussions. Studio physics is one example. This is more effective in real-time. I encourage departments to offer more real-time engagement opportunities as it is more efficient, more effective, and helps foster community. Students feel more supported when they can talk with their instructors and peers. These sessions should not be required and/or alternative asynchronous options should be available to students that can‚Äôt guarantee their schedule. 
i.	Many activities are well suited for a synchronous virtual classroom
1.	Studio-style problem solving sessions
2.	Group lab work
3.	Recitation-style smaller classroom sessions
4.	Real-time tutor support
b.	Asynchronous ‚Äì Part of being flexible for students with non-traditional schedules means offering Asynchronous options and/or facets of your course. If these are alternatives to synchronous assignments/events they should provide as equivalent an experience as possible. 
i.	Some work can be better suited for asynchronous engagement 
1.	Homework ‚Äì largely already implemented asynchronously
2.	Larger/longer projects
3.	Peer review of homework, lab reports/notebooks, exams, etc. 
4.	Reflective and meta-cognitive writing
c.	Blended/hybrid
i.	The benefits and best practices shared here can also be relevant to traditional students. I encourage replacing/supplementing some traditional learning time with online activities. Flipped classrooms where content delivery is moved online is one small example. Be careful not to simply add work. If you want engage students in an online activity, consider removing some other component. This could be removing a lecture to carve space for the new mode of work/collaboration. 
d.	Project-based
i.	Taking class online can create new opportunities such as longer/larger project-based activities. These tend to fit students who need asynchronous activities but it doesn‚Äôt only have to be asynchronous. There can be both synchronous and asynchronous aspects of the activity. It can be group/team based and those interactions can be in real-time or spread out of many days. It‚Äôs important to make both options available and try and form groups based on preferred engagement method. 

3.	Organization
a.	Clear roadmap ‚Äì Without regular f2f meetings with peers and instructional staff, online students need everything to be more organized and clear. Distance learners tend to engage with class resources such as the syllabus more frequently. If the path to mastery is not laid out clearly, they have a harder time navigating the curriculum.  
i.	Calendar ‚Äì centralized and integrated with learning platforms wherever possible. 
1.	Consider having one page (or calendar) with links to all assignments, study resources, and learning platforms. Organize by clear compartmentalized learning modules in a chronological order. Students tend to not draw boundaries based on content but rather by time. Even if you design to natural content breaks, present the outline to students along timeline breaks, like weekly or biweekly modules. 
ii.	Compartmentalized modules ‚Äì It‚Äôs important to break the class into small digestible chunks that students can use to plan their time more carefully. Having multiple weeks where the topic is covered by many chapters in a traditional textbook, and one large homework due multiple weeks later, leaves more room for students to unknowingly fall behind. 
1.	Weekly or smaller is preferred. I find two or three modules a week to be ideal. 
b.	Use of a Learning Management System (LMS) ‚Äì Most universities have a campus-wide LMS that students use in all their classes. Leverage this tool as it is where most students are used to basing their classes out of.
i.	Every assignment, from reading, to homework, to lab, to even exams, should be setup as an assignment with a due date, even if they don‚Äôt turn the work into the LMS. This puts everything in one calendar and students use that for alerts on what is due. It‚Äôs fine if they then upload it to some grading software or something else, just as long as it‚Äôs in the LMS calendar.  
c.	Centralized platform for all links
i.	Online classes usually require a host of specialized learning software, especially in STEM courses like physics. Examples include: LMS, grading software like Gradescope, clicker software, online textbooks, Zoom, OneNote, homework systems like Masteringphysics, Peer-review software like Peerceptive, Excel, Tracker, Pivot interactives,‚Ä¶ and the list goes on and on. Make sure all of those are organized and findable from one central location, like the LMS. Students express overload when there are too many platforms but that frustration is highly mitigated if there is a central location of links. 
ii.	Be wary of specialized learning tools creep. It can be tempting to use the best piece of software for every little aspect and in the end students are engaging with 10+ programs.
1.	Consider the length of the course when deciding about what platforms to use. If it is a single class, creating a high barrier to entry may not be worth it. If it‚Äôs a year-long sequence, and the plethora of tools is worth it, it can be more acceptable to expect the extra time to learn all of the pieces in the system. 
d.	Proper training on each software platform ‚Äì don‚Äôt assume that because your students are distance learners that they already ‚Äúget‚Äù software and computers. Distance learners tend to span a wider range of age groups and a wider range of technical knowledge than traditional students.
i.	Syllabus quizzes that block new content until completed at the start of the term can be effect. Along with questions that encourage them to read the syllabus, they can have tasks that help teach them the learning tools that are to be used in the class. Examples include scavenger hunts for content, requirements to login and register software, and even test runs on things like uploading lab/homework/exam assignments. Expect to spend extra time on this step with online learners to ensure stress is decreased during the term. Students struggling to upload an assignment because of technical issues experience high levels of unnecessary stress.
ii.	You might also consider a small training on file directory structure and consistent file naming conventions.  
e.	Notetaking/organization software ‚Äì with everything in digital format it is important to encourage students to adopt their preferred notetaking software. Examples include OneNote or Evernote. 
f.	Tablet ‚Äì physics requires solving questions by hand, typically with pen and paper. When everything is turned in digitally that results in an additional step to make a digital copy. Using a tablet skips that step and ensures the writing is still active content (unlike a static flattened pdf).
i.	Couple the tablet with something like OneNote and your students (and you) will be more organized. Consider publishing your homework, lecture templates, and other resources all through one platform like OneNote. 

4.	Budgetary considerations
a.	Instructional staff support per person increases ‚Äì a common preconception is that online classes are cheaper to deliver. In reality the number of students that can be properly supported online by one instructor is much less then in traditional f2f settings. One way to understand this is when one student asks a question in a live lecture, the answer informs potentially hundreds of students that had the same question. Online these interactions tend to be more one on one this takes a tremendous amount of human resources. OSU‚Äôs Ecampus for instance, a distance learning program ranked in the top ten nationally, suggests a budget of 2 to 1. Meaning if a full load for an instructor in a traditional f2f class is capped at 200 students, that number would be 100 for online courses.  
b.	Everything takes 30% longer ‚Äì I made up that number but almost every online teacher laughs and fully agrees. Online learning is not a path to efficiency. 
c.	Lab kit costs ‚Äì If your learning outcomes for lab include hands on activities that require purchasing a prepared lab kit, those costs can add up quickly. This is of concern for the already heavily financially burdened student base. I can also be a problem for the department if they have foot the bill upfront before the students make their purchase. There are companies that put kits together but they tend to have very high overhead costs. 
d.	Online proctoring ‚Äì Can be effective to reduce cheating but also costs the students significant money, upwards of $45 per event. 
e.	Open Educational Resources (OER) ‚Äì If all the engagement is already online, I suggest going one step further and using digital OER to cut costs. The publisher‚Äôs textbook is not as valuable as most think and the majority of students do not find the resource useful and end up Googling things anyways. Stop the cycle, go OER. Okay that was my unabashed plug for OER‚Ä¶ just as relevant to f2f classes ÔÅä 

5.	Community
a.	Creating a vibrant inclusive community where everyone feels supported and owns their role is the most important aspect of any class. This becomes exceedingly challenging in the online environment. You have to get creative and approach the issue from a number of different directions. This is your biggest challenge!
b.	Learning Assistants (LAs) and TAs ‚Äì It is best to have a multi-level support system for your class that leverages the strengths of the various members.
i.	LAs provide near peer that is unique to any other role in the team. Students feel far more comfortable asking questions they feel could be perceived as dumb or invalid to LAs than to TAs and instructors. LAs can manage the professional social media platform and help answer all those little questions that tend to fill an email box. They can also help in a number of other ways such as: fielding questions in synchronous/asynchronous events, holding study sessions, providing formative feedback on assignments, organizing and facilitating group learning, providing non-class-specific support like directing them to other university resources, and general community building. I can‚Äôt stress enough the importance of their role in any class. They are best return on investment you can find in my opinion. 
ii.	TAs typically know the physics better but are farther removed from the students. They are often grad students that never attended UG at that institution. As a consequence they may know less about the life of their students than the LAs. Use TAs as the first line of defense on supporting physics content.  
c.	Professional social media platform ‚Äì a digital study room where students can come together to ask questions that LAs, TAs, instructors, and fellow students can collectively answer.
i.	This can be a message board service through an LMS but the functionality of such systems can be limited.
ii.	One suggestion is to use a platform more ideal for this type of engagement. Something that allows spontaneous real-time audio/video conferencing. Something with integrated digital whiteboards. Examples include Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Discord. 
1.	Check that your usage doesn‚Äôt violate FERPA. Discord is so open it is hard to maintain privacy. But it is a platform many students are already on‚Ä¶ 
iii.	It‚Äôs important to differentiate this from other forms of communication. One suggestion is to use the social media platform for physics questions and questions about the working of the class. Things that everyone can help answer so that the burden isn‚Äôt only on the instructor. Leverage the community. Other questions about grades or administrative stuff should still be left to email so that there is a clear record and privacy is maintained. 
d.	Communication ‚Äì Students need to know they are supported and the first step in that process is open and clear communication. When everything goes online you quickly learn the value of small f2f interactions. These can still occur in the online environment but they looks and feel different.
i.	Availability ‚Äì your students need interaction with peers and instructional staff. You must make these human resources readily available.
1.	Clearly stated boundaries are important as they serve as guidelines for students. State when each member is available and the best mode to connect. Be careful of boundary creep where students expect too much of your time.  If you have to miss that time, make sure that is communicated to your students as soon as you know your absence. When possible give an alternative contact such as a TA or LA.
2.	Consider a contract that both you and your students agree too. An example is that from Monday through Friday you will respond to any question within 24 hours. You could go even further and expect that during that same time period students are expected to check their messages (email, Slack, message board).
ii.	Checking in your students ‚Äì it‚Äôs important to check on your students at the very least once a week. Consider a traditional f2f class that meets 3 times a week. That 3 times a week you ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù on your students. It may not be in practice a meaningful check in but it feels like one to the student, especially when there is formative assessment (like clicker questions) associated with class. 
iii.	More is better than less ‚Äì error on the side of too many announcements or check ins. 
iv.	Fun videos telling them you‚Äôre thinking about them ‚Äì you need to humanize yourself to your students. One way of doing this to send little videos showing the human side of your life. An example is to take a short ~1 min video with your phone while your digging in the garden and to tell the students you‚Äôre thinking about them and all the hard work they are doing on their upcoming report or assignment. 
v.	Tone ‚Äì with a lot of communication moving to text and/or video, spend extra time ensuring the tone of your voice is welcoming and inclusive. Many students already fear their instructors and they may read what you write to mean something you never intended. 
e.	Group/team learning ‚Äì There is a gradient of collaborative work with groups on one end and teams on the other. I won‚Äôt try and define what constitutes team-based learning from group-based but ways that they can be differentiated are analyzing the scope/time of the project, how many people are working together, whether there are formal roles, and whether the people have/will develop lasting relationships. 
i.	Synchronous
1.	Virtual breakout rooms (like in Zoom) can be used to allow collaboration like that in a Studio Physics classroom. 
a.	Getting students to talk and contribute can be the biggest difficulty. Defining roles, like someone dedicated to sharing their screen with the content everyone is working on visible, can help keep communication flowing. 
i.	Other roles can be defined and those can rotate through students. Scribe, equipment operator (like in a lab), presenter, skeptic, are examples of roles.
ii.	LA/TA support can really provide leadership in these sessions. 
b.	Most digital whiteboards allow exporting the work as an image. 
c.	Students should have at the very least a computer with a camera and microphone. 
2.	Clear session objectives ‚Äì everyone needs to know goals and what product they are to be producing. 
ii.	Asynchronous
1.	Can be inefficient but provides the most flexibility
2.	Time delay between replies can be problematic
3.	Can be an advantage for longer/larger activities

6.	Lab goals
a.	Experimental design
b.	Data analysis
c.	Communication skills
i.	Collaborating on experiments can be difficult asynchronously
d.	Inquiry-based vs. prescribed labs
e.	Physical experiments vs. virtual experiments
f.	Project-based labs

7.	Accessibility 
a.	I like this being a main effective practices even though it could fit under flexibility because it highlights the importance. If someone decides to use UDL guidelines to make an online course they are likely to realize how their traditional class could be more accessible
b.	Universal design for learners (UDL)
"
I was teaching very different courses on those two terms (graduate majors vs. undergraduate non-majors).
"I taught a flipped course in Spring 202 so lectures were prerecorded.  In the fall of 2020 I taught an upper level majors course that I had not taught for several years. I found it difficult to balance at the same time all of keeping track of the calculation I was doing in lecture, making sure that my writing was visible to students, referring to my notes, and addressing student questions. I also missed having a large blackboard for calculation which sometimes took several pages on the pad I was sowing via a document camera."
"We use a studio format to teach Physics II (Cal based).  The class is small (12) so I brought them back to campus after four weeks.  Normally there is a lot of interaction because we incorporate labs and problem sessions into the two hour thrice a week meetings.  Not in this case, however.  The distancing and mask requirements made doing labs almost impossible and the students barely interacted with each other during problem sessions.  The only advantage was I could lecture live (even though I had recorded every lecture ahead of time just in case) and the students could ""see"" each other live.  The main advantages to studio format were completely lost.  In a sense, I kind of regretted hauling them all back to campus, even though I know they didn't like Zoom.  As far as labs went, I preferred the virtual ones (and spreadsheet calculations they did on electrostatics) to the live circuit labs.  Why?  Your natural instincts take over when you teach for 30 years and it was all I could do to maintain distancing when I was helping them with labs.  It really wasn't worth it because it was more risk than it should have been.  This coming semester I have 16 in the class and there is no way I'm going to meet with them in a room on campus.  The Covid case count is too high and I'm 64 almost 65 years old.  I'm not taking any chances this time around.  I'll think about going back to campus if and when we all get vaccinated.  Until then, we can Zoom.  One perk about Zoom though, the students could Zoom with me any hour of the day if they had questions.....and they did.  Bottom line: Teaching in person with the pandemic restrictions in place really isn't much fun, and it's nothing like teaching in a normal setting.  Most of my Physics colleagues had classes that were too large to meet face to face, but I told them they were not missing anything.  It will be far more fun when we can teach ""normally"" again."
"The biggest difference was the preparation and expectations of the students. The students simply did not adapt well to the new format in the Spring, and in the Fall more of them knew what to expect. However, in both cases it was plainly evident that some students had more difficulties engaging with the material and participating in discussions compared to face-to-face settings. The two big hurdles I see are technological and psychological. Specifically, physics students need access to pen-based platforms (e.g., ipad or Surface) that they can use to write equations and sketch - this is absolutely necessary for introductory physics. We also need a better video platform that allows for more seamless and organic small group discussions - Teams and Zoom are terrible at this. Students seem much less self-disciplined and able to recover from failure, even when courses are structured to accommodate that. Failure is a critical component of learning, but the culture's obsession with performance and grades is increasing, and makes a growth-based mindset difficult to foster."
"To make zoom breakout groups work for cooperative learning (e.g. pair share) you need to provide clear ""ice breaker"" questions to get them talking. And you need to monitor continually."
Fewer and more lenient grades help student performance
I taught summer classes so I felt well-prepared to teach in the fall.
"The main course I taught was different in each semester. Hands-on, inquiry-based classes require different transition strategies than lecture/discussion classes."
Online teaching sucks!  I don't get the feedback from the students faces and body language as I can in face-to-face classes.  And I have to give multiple choice tests online; I would NEVER do that in a face-to-face class.  And any administrators who like the transition to online because it saves money should rethink their positions in the wake of what is a demonstrably inferior method of teaching.
"During Spring, I taught some courses asynchronously due to recommendations I received.  I found some students loved this and others hated it.  For Fall, I switched to all synchronous.  Now for Spring 2021, since some students like one method and some like the other, I have both options.  I am teaching synchronously, but the students can also watch the pre-recorded videos if they prefer."
On line lectures with student groups has proved to be far more effective than anticipated.
"It was much smoother as we were able to go into the semester with a plan.  I made a plan that would allow a flow from hybrid (in person and online simultaneously) to online only at the drop of a hat.  Students did much better this semester I feel due to there being a class that everyone attended in some way, and there was a community building aspect. "
"I set up some early semester times for students to drop in, chat, and meet me. Only about 20% of students took advantage of this but it helped with community for those that did stop by. Like many I am concerned about academic honesty on remote exams. My students are monitored via webcam (no browser lock down) and I use oral exams as a back up measure to validate knowledge if I suspect cheating or a compromised exam. This has generally worked well for me, though I won't claim that I am preventing all academic dishonesty. "
Online teaching is bad for the students. Can't wait to get back to the real thing - in front of students.
Since I was able to meet my studentes face to face it was fine.
"I found that students were more willing to work remotely in groups doing exercises in Spring 2020 after March after having doing group activities in class and at-home  in groups than they were in Fall 2020, never having had the opportunity to build a sense of community in person that they had in other semesters."
"Through my experience teaching remote synchronous courses in Fall 2020, I now regard a few elements I felt were important previously to be even more important. 
1) Importance of creating and sustaining social connection within the class community.  This includes getting to know students, letting them get to know me, providing opportunities for them to get to know one another, responding to email promptly and in-depth, checking in with students about ""how things are going"", etc. 
2) Be flexible regarding course deadlines.  Display compassion for students who are struggling to meet course deadlines.
3) Trust students.  I mean regarding academic integrity.  But also talk to them about that explicitly.  
4) Be more willing to explore informal connections of the course content to interesting but perhaps only tangentially related issues.  These include physics content from somewhat outside the scope of the course, current events, students' non-physics academic interests. "
"Completely different vibe from spring to fall. Spring was like trying to damage control. Nobody signed up for remote instruction, and we were just trying to survive, make the final six weeks productive, despite all sorts of new technical challenges. But in the fall, everyone knew going in that the course would be fully remote, what that would entail, and how to solve the inevitable technical challenges. While I much prefer face-to-face, Fall 2020 went ok, and I'm not anxious about my upcoming remote spring 2021 course."
"We had a lot more time to prepare for fall 2020 than spring quarter. So my classes were better structured, but the amount of revision required (particularly for lab classes) was gigantic, so the end result was still quite rough. And student expectations were much higher in fall, as were the expectations of administration and the Board of Trustees (which liked to blame faculty for enrollment declines). While online was the right call, students were openly talking about dropping out (and some did drop out) because of the lack of face-to-face classes. We need politicians to understand that colleges are not like restaurants. It's sad if a restaurant closes during the pandemic, but restaurants close and open all the time. If a college fails, that's pretty permanent, and could leave an entire region without access to public higher education.

I think one of the primary things to understand is that students taking online by force are a completely different population than students who chose to take online before. So a lot of the ""best practices"" for online teaching were actually irrelevant junk, because they were designed for a different population. A lot of our students had taken online before, and explicitly rejected it in favor of F2F - until the option was taken away. (But my F2F classes couldn't be run during a pandemic, distanced and masked, even if we thought that were safe.)"
"In Spring, we went online with very little notice and hacked together whatever we could do to finish the semester. In the Fall, I dramatically re-designed the class to make sense online. Because it was asynchronous, this had the effect of being a ""flipped classroom"", which is something I'd been thinking of doing anyway, but now I had no choice."
"Lab science classes are extremely difficult to translate to online only courses and require a GREAT DEAL of time to do well.  I have been working approximately 80 hours per week for between 15 and 17 hours of contact time (including lecture, discussion and labs) since March.  It is unsustainable and I wish there was more ready help that was worthwhile available.  I felt for fall that I had some time to utilize what I had learned over spring and summer (I taught both spring and summer session) but I was teaching more classes including a class that had a very specific purpose of teaching guided inquiry science teaching techniques along with content that had to be completely re-worked for the hybrid style we used this fall."
"We restructured our labs so that the number of students in the room was extremely limited, allowing about a 12 foot buffer between stations. All students worked independently instead of with a partner. All surfaces in the labs we sanitized by me before each class. We had all classroom doors open with supplemental means enhancing airflow through the room. We had active air purifiers cycling air in the room. We allowed students to miss class without penalty if they had any symptoms. Our university provided testing for all students, my TA, and myself each week."
"My institution went remote-only and sent all the students home after one week in the fall, so the only choice of instructional mode I had was synchronous vs. asynchronous (I used a mixture).  One advantage to Zoom teaching is that the students' names are shown, so I learn them more quickly.  Hands-on experimentation is all but impossible in this mode, and breakout rooms are only a limited substitute for small-group engagement in person.  Obviously it was easier to pivot hands-on activities (e.g. by making videos of the experiments and giving the students the data to analyze) in the fall when we had more lead time.  But inevitably the unstructured exploration that hands-on work fosters was missing.  Since my students were first-semester undergraduates, they really needed the opportunity to bond with one another and create community when they arrived on campus, and that was very difficult remotely.  Fortunately my students were all in the same time zone.  Although the class was mostly synchronous, I recorded the sessions in case somebody had internet problems.  One student skipped most of the synchronous sessions in favor of viewing the recordings, because he had to take a job to replace the work-study job he would have had on campus and the hours conflicted with our class time.  Needless to say, this did not help him succeed.  "
"Cheating in large lecture classes (250 students) was a very large issue in the spring, and not an issue for my 25-30 student fall classes.
Having a good pen tablet to do grading via PDFs is a must.
Being visible to students during an on-line lecture is a must.  (No Khan Academy style.)
"
"The only thing that differed is that the students seemed better prepared for participating via Zoom than
they did in the spring"
The election and covid have been huge stressors.  It's hard to disaggregate their effect from the stress of learning how to teach online 
"Spring 2020 (face-to-face, except for the last 3 weeks due to COVID shutdown when I taught online) I taught the same large class as in Fall 2020 (hybrid class).  Teaching hybrid is hard.  I had to always be consciously aware of what both audiences were experiencing and could not do the same demos and interactions that I would normally do (took too much time or there were hardware issues specific to my institution).  I initially felt it was not worth it but the second half of Fall 2020 I changed my mind and felt that the in person component of the hybrid class was critical for me and for the students.  I need a live audience.  Students who attended in person did better than those who attended online (I did a correlation analysis with their attendance style and their test scores).  My students were allowed to attend every other class but anyone could attend fully online if they chose to.  After a few weeks I realized I could allow anyone to attend live that wanted to since many chose to just attend online."
"In fall my 2nd year grad course was not so different than spring. However, now in winter (we are on quarter system) I'm teaching a 300 student lecture course with 7 TAs and online laboratories, etc, so I wish you had asked me about this one.  Anyway I'm learning a lot, about Canvas quizzes, gradescope, Zoom recordings, white boards, etc.  This one is very difficult."
"I was surprised by student response.  Initially students either prospered (most of them), or foundered (a few of them disappeared after the first day).   Perhaps because of my reaching out, fewer than I expected seemed to check out emotionally.  They continued to actively participate and enjoy working together.  
I was surprised when near the end a significant number of students with whom I felt a good connection simply quit, - not taking -or not doing well on the final.  They were simply done, and no encouragement nor new opportunities enticed them. This group of  students was on track to do better than they might have formerly done in one of my face-to-face classes.   But these A or B students dropped two full grades over the last module of the course.  They constituted perhaps 6 to 8% of the class."
"Teaching remotely is makes it more difficult than face-to-face for reaching out and keeping attention and contact with students that are disconnecting from the class. The hardest thing is therefore not to do what works in class, it is to address issues that show up, because they are harder to address. "
"I actually liked the way the spring class was set up (which reflected how it was taught it person), and adapted by fall class to the same format. The format was recorded/written lectures, and in-class worksheets."
The knowledge that we were going to teach online ahead of the start of term enabled me to set pieces in place to make the Fall 2020 semester run more smoothly than the Spring 2020 semester. I feel that I was in survival mode in the spring of 2020 and now things are moving along in a more predictable manner.
Vast majority of the students in my class felt learning Physics online was extremely difficult. I think online instruction can work quite well for upper level classes but not for introductory courses.
"I think teaching labs face-to-face provides a much better training and is quite safe with good masks, face shields, ventilation, and some distancing. Though masks make communication and sympathy with struggling students much harder..."
"The larger of my classes was the Classical Electrodynamics class, one of the core graduate classes. I chose to proceed as I had in the Spring: lecture from home using a large white board I had procured, streaming the lectures over zoom, and recording them and making the recordings available to the students. There was interaction, the students were comfortable asking questions. Although not as good as being face to face in a class, this worked quite well, the students were happy with it, and they did pretty well on the exams, so I would say it was a success. I do not think it was better than lecturing live, face to face, and as soon as we can I will return to that, although continuing to make recording of the lectures available to the students would be a good thing. Full disclosure, I am a research scientist is a facility on campus, and I am quite senior. I've been teaching because the physics department asked me to, and because I enjoy and value it. Teaching has absolutely no impact on my career path. "
"I had fewer students going through crises in Spring 2020.  In Fall 2020, 4/33 of my students and one of my TAs got COVID.  I had at least a partial daycare outage for about 1/3-1/2 of the time in Fall 2020.  Between mid-Aug - Thanksgiving, we had exactly two consecutive weeks when we had the same schedule in my family, due to holidays, quarantines, and child care outages.  Teaching was in triage mode.  In contrast, in Spring I had planned well and just had to adapt the plan.  The last month and a half of Spring 2020 was rough, but I at least started in a reasonable place.  I started Fall 2020 behind.  A lot of non-essentials got dropped.  I actually did better with technology in Spring 2020 because fully online is a lot easier than having to set up all of the technology to manage a hybrid classroom.  It also felt like Spring 2020 was more forgiving because we didn't expect it.  It felt like we should do better in Fall 2020, but I don't think I did."
Important to have someone else to answer chat questions in the zoom webinar format.
The only real difference was that S'20 started face-to-face & switched to remote in early March.
"I was too accommodating for students in different time zones for the synchronous part of my class (I taught the same class 3 times to accommodate students). In Spring 2021, all synchronous components of the course will be one set time."
"Spring 2020 was a mad dash to change midway through the semester. Fall 2020 was better in that the entire course could be coherently and consistently designed to be online (primarily synchronous, in my case). That said, Spring 2020 that the students and I had gotten to know each other over the first half of the semester. This Fall, I taught all first year students who had (1) never met me, (2) never met each other and (3) mostly never even been on campus! That made the connection and community building aspect of the course much more difficult.   "
I tried a few different approaches during that Fall 20 that differed from the Spring 20.  Some of those strategies I am discarding for Spring 21and trying some other new ideas.  Flexibility and willingness to adapt or discard is key.
"The experience/'growing pains' from transitioning online in the spring made it easier to adapt the entire course from the beginning in the fall. It was easier to clarify student expectations from the beginning, in contrast to being kind of ad hoc in the spring- student motivation was generally lower in the fall 2020 than in a typical semester. 

"
"Spring 2020 was a good warm-up for fall 2020. I used the spring to figure out how to teach online, and then it was pretty smooth when I went hybrid in the fall. But in both semesters I was teaching graduate courses. I will teach undergraduates this upcoming spring and am now investigating how to do a hybrid course with a very different audience."
Some changes are really good - recording classes and having more material available online outside of class time allows students to revisit or review material they missed.
"Online instruction impacts health (via ergonomics and social interactions, or lack thereof) and mental well being. This is not being recognized by academic institutions other than lip service."
Students are not doing as well in remote settings. That's the main thing. Also that the amount of time spent teaching and organizing is more for my remote class.
"Used more ""low value"" assignments to keep students engaged, tried with limited success to encourage more student questions; for some reason, fewer students chose synchronous participation in fall than previous spring"
"Students were much more critical of teaching and exhausted. It was difficult to get more than four or five of them do what they were asked (out of a hundred) in spite of reaching out and helping in a myriad of ways, large and small. All online exam proctoring options do not work at all. Still, students could not cope with standard exam questions although they almost certainly all cheated quite heavily."
Thanks for doing this!
"In the spring I had a personal relationship to students from the first half of the semester before transitioning, which made the interaction much more personal.  That relationship is very weak when teaching completely remotely, as videos (except mine) are normally off for bandwidth.

During the summer and fall I found that the testing is the most difficult aspect of class management.  After finding my final exams completely on CHEGG with solutions coming back during the 3 hour test, I completely changed my testing strategy.  I give more tests with half the time, which is difficult for a number of students.  This is contrary to my belief that physics problem solving is not a speed issue, but I could not find a viable solution at this level.  Still Respondus is only partially a solution - good cheaters need less than 10 minutes on CHEGG using another device such as a phone, if the problem is somewhat close to a standard problem.

"
Our institution has become much more accommodating about online and HyFkex teaching. I learned a lot (especially producing videos and moving to meaningful online exams) and embrace the new opportunities. Teaching Physics is as enjoyable as it has ever been.
"Spring was a scramble to have ANYTHING ready.  Fall we were able to take on board lessons learned from the spring.  

We conducted extensive focus groups with students and faculty at the end of the spring to help us all.  The results were analyzed, synthesized, summarized, and shared with the department."
"The biggest difference was that in Spring 2020 this was a second semester of a course sequence, so I taught all students face to face before and knew them and they knew me. I had excellent rapport with my students. The rest of the spring semester when we went online there was a sense of community and students were actually happy to be together, at least virtual. We all worked together to make the best of the situation.

I found it much harder to connect with the students I only knew from online instruction. Also the motivation of the students was lower in Fall 2020 and many seemed to have the intention of just ""checking the course off"" and having it done, rather then intending to actually learn. For example I had serious cheating issues in Fall 2020. 
I also had excellent academic support offered to my students using both TAs and PLAs as facilitators in study sessions. I found that only a small number of students made use of them (even though this small number did so every week)."
My course load was increased by one course 3 days before semester as a TA could not travel back to USA.This made my load way too much. I taught 2-3 zoom lectures most days. I felt used.
"The classes were very different. Spring was a algebra based survey, fall was inquiry based preservice teacher course. I had the hybrid option which I did not have in spring. "
"There was more time to plan, which made a lot of difference."
Our institution started online teaching in the Spring of 2020 so I had a little bit of experience before the Fall semester. Summer was a great time to adjust all my instruction materials and strategies for online teaching.
"Thanks to what I figured out in the last 2/3 of Spring semester, I was pretty confident about what I needed to do for Fall. I knew that I was going to use Teams for synchronous lectures for my large intro physics class (54 students) with Top Hat to check on student understanding and to give them some practice with questions. For recitations, I figured out how to divide them into groups so that they could interact while working out problem on paper with TA support. That worked quite well on Teams. I used my TAs to proctor (and record) exams in breakout rooms on Zoom (which allows you to see a gallery of students better). That turned out to be less stressful for the students and more reliable than ProctorTrack (which suddenly shut down for several weeks partway through the semester). As with our face to face classes, we used our LON-CAPA online homework system for homework and pre-class assignments (as usual). We used the Creative Commons Open Stax University Physics as the textbook, as we have done for a several years. For Labs, I created Teams courses for each lab section and put the TAs in control of their section. Labs were a mix of videos of me doing the lab (these required the students to make readings of scales themselves from the videos) and PhETs (for situations like DC circuits where watching me do it would not be rewarding). The generation of the lab videos (and making sure that the closed captions were correct and accurate) was a *large* time sink (I was teaching the only section). My 4 TAs were very helpful. "
Students suffer from lack of social interaction and study group formation in in-person lectures.
"For the question asking about what tools were used I only listed those that were new or significantly different - to coincide with the following question.

Everything on Zoom takes longer (than in person).

Hybrid (some people in-person with other remote) is awkward at best. It is particularly difficult to maintain inclusivity for those who are online (particularly if they don't have their cameras on).  I didn't get much practice, though, as the University switched to remote only after the first week.

Some revised activities are worth keeping post-pandemic."
"Easier in Fall because we could prepare for it.   On the other hand, I had a good personal rapport with students in Spring before we went remote, and it was not easy to build that relationship in Fall"
"I had much more time to prepare for Fall of 2020 and my courses were much better. However, I also had much higher expectations for myself. It was a huge amount of work to follow through with all those plans, and I found myself working until the wee hours of the night more often than I would like to admit.

Things were also more difficult because although my kids got to go to school occasionally, they often got sent home when they got sick or a classmate or a teacher did. Having to provide childcare during the day and teach is really difficult. This is part of why I made my classes largely asynchronous, so that I could work at night after my kids went to sleep (good golly I've been burning the midnight oil). 

My university has been having COVID related retrenchment talks. That is why my job suddenly feels less secure than it did last year. "
"I spent the summer tooling-up for remote teaching. The most important tool was a tablet device with a stylus and note-taking app, to use with Zoom, or in a recorded video, the way I would use a blackboard during class. Without that I was quite crippled during spring 2020 and had to just expect students to read (which most of them find distasteful). I also needed a better computer to run video recording/editing software, and I learned to make and edit videos of myself working on the tablet. I also spent time figuring out how to stage some demonstration videos. It took a while to figure out what video software I needed to acquire and learn to use, and then to learn to use it. For this I got some ""consulting"" help from the multimedia experts at my institution."
"In Spring 2020 I taught a large course (250 life science  students in two sections) on line, in Fall 2020 I taught a class of 30 majors on line, so the difference between the size of the classes and their engagement colors a lot of how I perceived my class in the Fall (even though on line).  I felt a much stronger engagement with the and connection to the students in the fall course."
Spring 2020 was much more difficult because we had to switch to on-line in the middle of semester. We had the whole summer to prepare for Fall. 
"Being able to teach in-person with streaming was much better than teaching all-online. The main benefit was the reduction in cheating. However, all students who failed were ones that streamed; mostly due to lack of continued engagement on their part (they stopped attending the synchronous sessions)."
"students have learned how to cheat much better, whether they have learned any physics or not"
"Taking some online classes over the summer really helped me to see how to take advantage of the online modality.  However, while I think the students were mostly content, I hated teaching online.  Basically, my function became grader/tech support.  So that's a thing to know for the ""after-time""."
My biggest concern is online cheating due to non-in-person examination.  Online proctoring is a joke.
"Fall 2020 was slightly smoother since we knew what to expect. However, the transition to remote in spring 2020 was smooth because we had a half-semester in person.  I was able to include a reasonable amount of in-person time early in the fall 2020 semester while our community cases were very low, and that helped us with a smooth and early transition to entirely remote instruction in late October. I made this decision to switch to all remote early, about a month before our university also decided to switch to remote early (1 week earlier than initial plan of final 2 weeks remote)."
The university was much more prescriptive about the class styles. The administration strongly pushed for in person and manipulated health data and recommendations to achieve their goal. The result was many COVID infections among students.
"I was teaching a small graduate course in Fall 2020, as opposed to a large undergraduate course in spring 2020, which made an enormous amount of difference."
"In march 2020 went 100% online.  The major problem was the University provided inadequate technology.  The desktop the University provided me lacked a microphone and camera.  I brought my desktop home and did class on Google Meet, sharing the screen to show my PowerPoint and used my phone to talk to my class.  In the fall we were face-to-face with social distancing.  Labs had to be changed to accommodate for social distancing.  My lecture style changed, no wandering about the classroom and either modified my demonstrations or used you-tube videos."
"The biggest difference was in my first semester physics course, with mostly first time college students.  The remote nature of their courses, not being on campus around other students, and general not immersed in the college experience seemed to greatly hinder their ability to work.  More than 50% of the class had a homework grade lower than 50%.  My physics 2 class had 80% of the class completing the homework with a 90% or better.  Not doing the homework translated to very poor exam grades as expected.    "
"Students do not concentrate on learning
Students procrastinate to rehearsal lessons
Students might cheat more due to online tests"
"In Fall 2020 I taught a much larger class than in Spring 2020. I learned that students appreciate opportunities to get involved in the class (a great tool was the classroom response system I used, Top Hat), and any opportunities I give them to feel a personal connection in the virtual classroom (synchronous teaching is very important). I also learned how much of a problem cheating is; many students consult online sources of information cheat without being fully aware that it is cheating."
"Students seemed to like slack as a collaboration tool. This semester, Discord appears to be more popular with students."
"In Spring 2020, the switch to online happened mid-semester with no preparation.  However, the lessons learned during that switch allowed me to prepare for Fall 2020 and set up my course so the students would have an easier transition."
Most classes of hands-on-science could transitioned to online by using Youtube videos and experiment videos recorded on iPhone.
"In Spring 2020 I had to manage a sudden, unplanned, panicked, improvised transition of our Intro Physics 1 w/Calc lab to online. That meant winging it one lab at a time, with no at-home equipment for students to use. It was a disaster.

I spent all summer redesigning the entire Intro Physics 2 w/Calc lab to focus entirely around electronics, and I designed, sourced, and assembled take-home lab gear kits for students to pick up (or, for a few, get mailed) at the start of the term. I designed every f*ng lab to be self-paced and self-guided, using massively hacked Google Sheets to guide students through setup, data collection, analysis, and reflection.

It was NOT a disaster, but it damn near killed me. I only got through about 70% of the planned labs, 'cuz I just couldn't roll out the actual curriculum fast enough.

Fortunately, my Department Chair let me opt out of teaching the intro lab again this spring. üòÖ"
"In Spring 2020 I taught a primarily lecture based course which I had never taught before (in person or online).  In Fall 2020, I taught three courses which I had previously taught in person.  The prep for converting these three courses to hybrid/online was substantial and I would consider it to be equivalent to a new course prep. 

Another important aspect of my teaching in Fall 2020 which differed from Spring 2020 was that I converted an intro physics course which had been about 25% lecture and 75% groupwork when taught face to face into a hybrid or fully remote/synchronous format. Most of the faculty in my department did not attempt to reproduce the expectations for groupwork in online teaching of this course, but I decided to try.  I used breakout rooms in Zoom, which involved a lot of trial and error.  It would be great for there to be better documentation about how to use breakout rooms to best effect (e.g. how to assign breakout rooms in advance to keep group assignments the same, not opening the breakout rooms too early to prevent students from being unassigned, etc). Ultimately I believe that this format was successful and I had students tell me that the course was their best-organized online class.  

The biggest challenge I faced was integrity of exams.  Despite using the Lon Capa software to assign different numbers for all the students on the exam problems, there was clearly cheating occurring. I did not pursue this cheating with the honor council, but instead just to be very lenient with my grading for students who seemed not to cheat.  As a result, all my students in the intro class passed with a C- or above, which was the minimum allowed to have an opportunity to go on to the next course in the sequence.  Typically I have about 10-15% of my students in this course receive a grade below C-, requiring them to retake the course if they wish to progress. However, this semester I didn't feel confident penalizing students who failed exams because they refused to cheat when there was significant evidence of cheating among the others in the course.    "
"Increased flexibility in grading alleviated a lot of student stress. I implemented a grading scheme that weighted students highest scores the most of the lowest scores the least on aspects including; homework, exams, in-class participation. "
"I used the respondus/webcam software for my quizzes in fall 2020, but not in spring 2020.   This was a HUGE improvement.  In the spring, there was a vast amount of cheating on the quizzes (judging from pre-spring-break to post-spring-break grades, with a huge jump in quiz grades after spring break when we went on-line).  In contrast, with the respondus/webcam software, the quiz scores were typical of normal semesters, leading me to conclude that there was far less cheating.  "
"Spring 2020 we sent all students home and had minimal time to learn and replace tools such as clickers for feedback or figuring out how to run remote discussion sections.  These became overnight remote classes and the focus was on simply allowing students to finish.  All lectures were suddenly taped and asynchronous.

For Fall of 2020 we had time to prepare for what we expected to face, hybrid classes.  We were able to find and choose methods for remote and live synchronous feedback as well as for complementing or replacing our regular lectures.  Much better experience, but still one that I am hoping to build on to improve this semester."
Our University opportunistically took advantage of the budget crunch associated with Covid to decrease budgets and increase teaching loads.  This is the framework that our efforts to make online version of the course took place under.
"My graduate Classical Mechanics course (Goldstein, Poole, and Safko) was already partially flipped and had been for years.  I just had to adjust to doing the synchronous part online.  It worked well, at least from what the students said."
"I was much more confident and comfortable throughout Fall 2020.  We were able to implement changes to the course based on our Spring 2020 experiences, including feedback from students.  As we were teaching mostly the same group of students (the introductory sequence started in the spring), these students were appreciative and as a result more open to engagement with the material."
"Fall 2020 we knew in advance about the pandemic. I made all our intro labs as F2F with one (1) remote section late Friday afternoon (for anyone who didn't go to a F2F section that week) ... so much better than trying to ""blend"" a lab."
"My comfort level with teaching in-person went from extremely anxious at the beginning of the semester to comfortable by the end once the evidence had accumulated that COVID was not being spread in the classrooms even if it spread somewhat amongst the students.

I rated all my courses as fully in-person, but this doesn't include the regular absence of random students for quarantine and their need to join via zoom. Especially for a lab course, navigating this challenge was very stressful on a daily basis."
Internet reliability issues and proctoring of online exams (we used Proctorio) was the single biggest cause of stress.  
"Nothing in my physics courses, my astronomy courses required the change."
"When we transitioned to all remote in Spring 2020, I essentially pre-recorded all lectures and labs and allowed students to work through the material at their own pace, with some specific due dates throughout the rest of the term. I did nothing synchronous and held no mandatory remote classes (I only held remote office hours, which were optional for students). In the Fall 2020, we were required by the administration to hold hybrid classes, so 1 day a week I held a remote zoom class and the other day of class was in-person. Everything was synchronous so students needed to stay caught up on everything. I think my method in the Spring only worked well for students who are self-motivated, don't procrastinate, and maybe have an inclination towards physics. Those who struggled with physics and/or motivation probably really struggled with this format. I think the method in Fall 2020 helped to keep students on track more, but it was definitely more work for me to plan out every minute of every class since all classes were held live (whether remote or in-person)."
"In some ways it was exactly the same.  I anticipated the events in March, so was already moving the class to a more remote instruction.  The same structure then worked well for after Thanksgiving when the students didn't come back.  The main difference was that students in Spring 2020 panicked.  I had a lot of incomplete since the students kind of took a holiday when in person classes were cancelled.  This didn't occur in the Fall 2020 class since the plan was in place from the beginning of the semester."
"In Spring 2020 we went online in the middle of the semester.  We had to improvise on a dime.  Spring break started normally but was extended ine week to give us (and the students) to get ready.  Fall 2020 was planned from the beginning to be online only.  I was more comfortable than most because I had taught an online asynchronous Conceptual Physics course (that I developed) for many years, and so knew many approaches and routines that were valuable.  Going online but synchronous was actually much easier than asynchronous.  But I will rejoice the day when we can go back in the classroom.  The students do perform better in a Asynchronous format than asynchronous because of two major factors: the regularity of the meetings helps keep them on task and, to my surprise, the fact that they can comment and participate by asking question without being ‚Äúseen‚Äù ( camera off).  It reduces their unwillingness to be recognized in a classroom setting."
"Moving to more and more synchronous work, so that students still benefit from peer learning online."
"We went online for the last 4 weeks of Spring 2020.  I learned that students needed additional structure, especially with due dates and schedules, and very predictable pattern of expectations.  They seemed to find it difficult to establish routine without the structure of classes.  Also, acknowledgements of the students' struggles and offers to consider extra time were very appreciated by students.  "
"In Spring 2020 I taught an introductory physics class, so we went 100% online.  In Fall 2020, I was teaching our undergraduate advanced lab class.  The university allowed limited in-person instruction for Fall 2020 in cases like lab and studio classes, so our department head, chief lab instructor, and I developed a plan to maintain the critical in-person hands-on laboratory part of the class.  Lectures became pre-recorded asynchronous, and we made the original lecture time a second lab section and split the students between them, in addition to spreading out the lab stations so that there was only one per room.  The class was already organized through Blackboard for distribution of course materials and lab submission and grading, so nothing there had to change.  Pre-recording and editing lectures was more time consuming than I anticipated, so I did not finish recording all of the material I'd hoped to.  I did try a discussion feature in Blackboard but it didn't result in more student interaction so I dropped it.  I did make a Slack discussion board with various channels, but the students also didn't use that to talk to each other and mostly used it to ask me questions, so it wasn't useless but wasn't what I hoped it would be.  I presume that they had other channels to communicate with each other that I didn't have access to.  Zoom for office hours and final presentations worked well.  The students and I are all very comfortable with technology, so we didn't have any technical problems, just the challenges of what is already a difficult course combined with reduced chances for interaction.  "
"Disheartened, I wonder if there will ever be a time at which I can associate freely with others in a social or professional setting without ""great"" bureaucratic intervention. "
"The importance of physical presence in teaching, for teacher and students. For students, everything needed to show up in class  --  getting dressed, eating, organizing books and notebooks, carrying materials to class, walking to class, finding a seat, etc., etc. -- everything helps a student to prepare mentally for class, and much of that is lost by on-line classes. "
I found Microsoft Teams more useful than ZOOM
"The main difference between last semester and pre-COVID-19 was the need to have synchronous and recorded lectures for those in quarantine.  Comparing to Spring 2020 doesn't work because the courses were completely different.  I did do a fully synchronous online course in Summer 2020 which prepared me for having a much better time with the online content of the course.  Office Hours seem to work better in a video chat environment.  However, online lectures, even with exact same content, were not as effective.  I also needed to do online testing.  What I found was that using Honorlock with tests in MasteringPhysics worked much better than directly using Canvas.  (More flexibility in the questions.)  In general, all students taking an identical exam online did at least one grade level worse.  (No evidence of cheating, although I can't say the same for what I tried in Canvas in Summer 2020.)  The classroom was set up for social distancing, otherwise the teaching was the same as previously.  Cameras were available for me to share and record the lecture."
"PHYS 2001 is first semester algebra-based intro. 2002 is second. Learned from last half of 2002 in Spring. Went online with 2001 with not a lot of time to prep in a compressed (7 week semester), asynchronous course. About killed myself trying to keep up with posting materials (videos, labs). Student interaction suffered with totally asynchronous and learning how to handle proctortrack. Fall taught large sections again with two colleagues for 2001. Reused a lot of materials successfully. Course already had a fair amount of online assessment (pre-class, homework) on LON-CAPA. Fleshed out and reorganized to try to make weekly expectations more clear (for online). In Fall used TopHat for 'class time' engagement during synchronous Teams meetings (had already been using TopHat in normal lecture, PRS before that). We haven't done anything amazing trying to get students in large lecture classes to engage peer-2-peer more, but we have created a reasonably smooth course with clear expectations and support for those students seeking it. We benefited dramatically from experience late last spring and over summer. This spring 2002 is online as well and the format is reasonably consistent for students' sake."
"Because of the hybrid format -  synchronous lectures,   etc. I had to use a document camera to write my lectures on a pad, which worked well for the remote students, who could see it well on their computer screen but didn't work so well for in-person attendees. Optics demonstrations did not be transmitted well online. There is no substitute for in-person teaching of physics. Difficult to connect with students. Students didn't use zoom office hours. Lectures could not be more interactive. My fault,  I had not quite learned  to switch back and forth between applications, video cameras, writing pad etc. "
"I felt more comfortable, but did not explore new tools to incorporate as I had envisioned that I would. Keeping up was more difficult than my previous year"
"Spring 2020 I was teaching 2 graduate level courses. They were small - dozen students each - with a lot of interaction. As I transitioned to remote mid-March, it was easy to keep the interactive culture going, since I knew the students and they were used to interrupting with questions and comments. The Fall 2020 class was larger - 24 undergrads from different years and majors - and previously unknown to me. It was hard to engage them interactively. I tried various strategies, but only managed to get 3 or 4 of them to ""talk"". I will be teaching grad students again Spring 2021, so I am more confident that they will be engaged."
I don't mind teaching online even after the pandemic 
"We had real challenges with academic integrity in the spring. Although I shifted assignment types to prioritize narrative, long-form mathematical answers and proofs, it was obvious there was an extensive network of collaboration and outright copying behind the scenes. In the fall, we switched to all group quizzes and exams, with a tutorial with grades participation. This was a better system in terms of integrity, it is difficult to asses whether or how it influenced learning outcomes."
"I'd say that online classes are significantly less fun for both teachers and students... but it's not fair to assess them given that we tried them in a pandemic. Moreover, I can see a blended environment where *some* classes are online being very helpful to students in the future. It might allow study abroad more easily for example. I would not make grand pronouncements about online education until we try it after the pandemic. 

One other thing‚Äîand this is a positive‚Äîis that I had never imagined that everyone on my faculty, including those who care little for education, were actually forced to try something new. I had conversations about teaching from people I wouldn't expect because of this, and I think this was a tremendous opportunity for PER."
"Spring 2020 I had no mechanisms at all for remote teaching from home.  I acquired equipment for remote instruction during the summer.  Preparation for classes during the term took an unsustainable amount of time, and students zoned out of static powerpoint presentations and computational animations that took quite an amount of time to set up.  This semester (Spring 2021) the students have universally applauded just using a camera looking down at my writing as if on a black board over prepared presentations and animations."
"I caught a lot more student cheating in Fall 2020.  We were required to use online tests, and even though there is a webcam watching them while they take the online test.  I'll admit that online testing does make cheating twice as easy for them.  But what students don't seem to realize is that it makes catching them 10 times easier."
"Having had a chance to observe the technological issues the students (and we!) had during the transition to remote learning in Spring 2020 and with more time to prepare resources and strategies to help, we basically became better at helping the students manage technological issues associated with remote learning. As a result, much more time was spent in Fall 2020 helping the students develop skills needed to engage effectively while learning from home rather than in a classroom. Spring 2020, in contrast, felt more like an exercise in training students in the use of technology. Because our remote classes were synchronous, we were able to maintain the general approach we used during normal in-person classes. The main challenge (for both the faculty and the students) was learning how to use technology to effectively duplicate as much as possible the in-person experience. That was the paradigm we used, at least... rather than adopt our methods for remote learning, we learned how to use available technology to approximate the in-class experience remotely."
"Teaching math or physics in the classroom involves writing and drawing diagrams on a dry erase board or chalkboard while talking. How is one to do this online? I have made two discoveries I would like to advertise. First, Microsoft sells a computer, the Surface Book, with a detachable monitor so that it becomes simultaneously a tablet and a computer. Put the tablet down on your desk and write out your notes with stylus or keyboard, reattach it to the laptop, bring up Zoom, and you are ready for class. The second discovery is the Microsoft program OnNote for Windows 10. It does wonders to make your online scribbles intelligible. It can turn illegible handwriting into perfect text and then change its color or font size to suit.

I get all this from the Math Dept. at LBCC. Apparently it's old hat for them."
"Upfront and clear communication about class expectations is essential. I had so many students who had to miss class for one reason or another, but would fail to account for it ahead of time, creating nightmares for me when I was giving assessments. I ended up being rather harsh about it simply for my own sanity since I couldn't be dealing with all of these exceptions left and right. My normal policy of dropping lowest scores in various categories was a lifesaver.

Both students and I appreciated having day-to-day responsibilities for the students extremely organized and clear on our LMS. This made things easier for them, and made frequent communication with me about course minutiae unnecessary. I'm very glad I took the time to create extremely organized modules in my LMS."
"Note that I'm just an adjunct instructor working under another professor for an introductory physics course -- I, along with my fellow graduate teaching assistants, do most of the grading and student interaction.

We taught half of Spring 2020 online due to the pandemic's onset in mid March, so we already had a basic plan for transitioning to fully online for the fall semester. Fall 2020 was not taught during a state of emergency as the second half of Spring 2020 was, so I would certainly say that Fall 2020 was an improvement over March-May 2020 -- we were able to conduct recitations over Zoom, perform synchronous lectures, and assign homework in Fall 2020.
Teaching online, however, is inferior to teaching in person for a number of reasons:
-low morale among both students and instructors, partly due to high communication barriers compared to the ease of communication in a physical setting
-no personal connection to students (I don't think I even know what most of them look like or sound like), which makes them less willing to ask for help or interact
-poor internet connections sometimes make deadlines difficult to meet and meetings difficult to conduct
-students don't develop physical measurement-taking skills in the lab
-grading online assignments sucks

Assessment of student understanding might be the facet that was most modified from the in-person format. Paper exams require students to show their work and justify their answers using their own knowledge; because grading online assignments is a big old bummer, we've swapped to a multiple choice format for exams, which really lowers the effort bar. Students probably appreciate this -- that's partly why it was done, I think -- but it's not a good way to check for content retention or reinforce understanding. The amount of energy poured into an online class compared to its yield (both in student performance and in instructor satisfaction) is significantly reduced relative to the energy and yield of an in-person class, and I don't think you can change that, no matter how many swanky tools you implement."
"A key observation is that students that attend remotely and don't turn on their cameras tend to be much less engaged. Presumably this is because they feel they can ""multitask"" while the lecture is running in the background. "
"With the teaching online experience from Spring and Summer 2020, I was better adjusted to the technology and the LMT we used in my department. I felt more comfortable. I learned about ""proctoring"" exams.
I am a bit more lenient in exams and grading but not a whole lot. I am not sure I would not want to teach online one day more than absolutely necessary. Doing experiments online is not DOING anything. The students are watching a video, they are not doing anything. This is a big deficiency. 
After Covid, I hope colleges and universities show their sincere interest in education by setting  aside 2 days a week for an entire year where those interested students can come and DO experiments in the physics lab under the supervision of instructors for free. We call it ""come and do all the experiments you did not do while online"".  I volunteer my free services. Thanks."
"I was much better prepared in the Fall, but it was a challenge because the class was larger and we had no face-to-face interaction at all -- especially that the students had no in-person interactions with each other, and it was very difficult for them to share their work and work effectively together. Managing group work via breakout rooms was slow, clunky and awkward. In general, everything was slower and clunkier. But still I thought the class went well, and, based on surveys and evaluations, the students agreed."
"Spring was all remote for us. Fall was hybrid.  Hybrid was more work, but it felt like we could use more of the 40 years of PER because it is mostly classroom based.  It seems like we need more research into synchronous remote instruction. "
