I learned some new features of Zoom, like screen annotations, breakout rooms, polling, yes/no buttons, chat, recording, and sharing YouTube videos that I integrated into classes. I already taught by annotating powerpoint slides on a tablet, so it wasn't too big of a change to use Zoom. The biggest challenge was the lack of audience feedback, so I used the yes/no buttons to ask if people understood tough concepts and used breakout rooms to drop in on 2-3 students at a time when I assigned group practice problems so that I could get some conversational feedback."

The closure of campus was late enough that all the students had the data for two of the three experiments they normally do during the semester.  They had an option to do a third experiment with an informal report, or turn one of the two into a formal report (for example, to submit to a journal).  The oral report component of the class was eliminated.  

My experience suggests that this course cannot be offered without access to the campus and the laboratory. We were fortunate that most of the hands-on work had been completed at the closure.  If something on line were offered, it would be a different course.  There is no way around that."

The main challenge was the need for the student to have access to specialized computers and software to do their data reduction for the class.  Our CSR's had already been exploring VM's to let students reach the packages they needed from anywhere in the world. That took care of one aspect of the lab class.  The second part I totally had to modify.  The class required hands-on telescope time with our robotic research telescopes.  That kind of died with leaving school. For fall I'm looking at some modifications that could let the students have at least part of the experience.

I saw too much focus in many of my colleagues on maintaining standards and preventing cheating and not enough on having some human compassion because our students are going through a lot.  I am creeped out by Respondus.  Students did not sign up to be video taped, let alone for a prof to change policies and mandate that they be video taped in their own home.

We have been teaching with a fully hybrid flipped classroom for years where the only difference between a f2f and online class is whether you're physically there or not. All resources, homework, and support were available online before this hit. We even had our online, hybrid, and f2f students attending the same synchronous lectures, interacting in breakout groups in a mixed form. We've had the option to attend or not by creating asynchronous assignments for a couple years. Our vision, which we've been working towards for about 5 years, was to offer a completely al carte model where you pick this week if you're going to attend lecture, lab, or recitation in person or engage remotely. We form groups to maximize diversity across all chosen paths.  For our class the transition was fairly smooth. The one place it has been difficult, and we are failing our f2f (remote) students, is labs. We have physical labs for the online students but those kits are expensive and take time to prepare so we didn't go that route for our f2f students who moved to remote learning. They are using simulations and there is evidence that they are not working as well as the online students who are doing physical experiments."

Face-to-face in-class time is focused on multiple-choice questions answered via Plickers, and group problem-solving sessions with TAs and instructor circulating among students engaging them with socratic questioning. Solutions to problems and questions projected on a white screen are discussed on a chalk blackboard to the side. 
For online transition, pre-class assignments and homework maintained same structure, except written homeworks were scanned by the students and uploaded to cloud storage (OneDrive) using a Google form. Synchronous online classes used Zoom meeting sharing a split screen showing a virtual keyboard implemented with ExplainEverything running on iPad with Apple Pencil, side-by-side with a pdf with problems being given, mimicking face-to-face class setup. Multiple-choice answers were assessed in real time using ""Polls for Canvas""app, and problem-solving sessions were implemented using Zoom breakout rooms of 3-4 students, where TA and Instructors jump from room to room using the same socratic questioning strategy. 
2h in-class exams transitioned to 3h take-home exams to be scanned and submitted for grading, with an explicit request that students abide by code of conduct and do not search for answers on the internet or consult among them or with third-parties. An appeal for honesty and fairness to their fellow colleagues was also made during the class before the exam. Score distributions for these take-home exams largely followed similar trends to in-class exams and written homework performance, thus showing no evidence of cheating. Course evaluations were identical to the ones obtained for first part of the course which was taught face-to-face in its entirety (4.8/5.0 group median), though 73% of students responded this semester compared to 54% last semester. Main shortcoming of online class was the inability to maintain Breakout Room student assignment from class to class, due to my university/college/department not having an institutional license with Zoom and instead relying in less flexible technologies like WebEx. This hindered peer instruction, as students would have to ""break the ice"" anew for the first group problem in every online class."

The way recitations work in my course, however, is that they're twice weekly lectures, just in a smaller group.  When we transitioned to online classes, the main instructor for the course moved to using Khan Academy to provide the students with some instructional material.  While the Khan Academy materials do have useful information, they aren't really full lectures, so I ended up taking over the bulk of the lecturing responsibilities.  I would provide a lecture during our regular course time via Zoom and then edit and upload the video footage from the lecture so that students who could not tune in during our regular class time could still access the material.  Based on emails that my students sent to me as well as course evaluations, my students really valued this course structure and felt like it kept things as close to normal as they could have been.  Some of them were a bit frustrated with the Khan Academy videos and wanted their regular lectures by the main instructor as well.  So, from my limited experience and small sample size, I found that providing a synchronous Zoom lecture done as a normal, at the whiteboard lecture, with an asynchronous video uploaded afterward seemed to meet the needs of the students well, but using prerecorded videos from other institutions was a bit less helpful."

This would have been much harder to achieve with a group of students who had never met each other. 
Indeed, in a previous experience teaching an asynchronous MOOC, we tried to add synchronous office-hours type sessions each week, but very few students participated. We also tried to create community through the discussion board, but did not have a lot of success in getting students to interact with each other."

I do not use chalk and chalkboard, but I do use a document writer and large screen (a digital projector) and write out the notes with the class and talk to the class as I write. Even face-to-face, before COVID19, I post all lecture notes, homework, quiz, and exam solutions in Blackboard. All students know their exact grade at all times. Transitioning online was easy, simply point a web cam at a legal pad and start teaching on Zoom, same as regular class (except they don't see me and I can not do live demos). Students appreciated that they did not have to learn anything new tech for the transition in my classes. The BIGGEST problem with online teaching is the cheating on the exams and ways to police it to ensure no cheating. Overall, despite the ~1/3 of the class taught online, it was a success. Some comments below indicate that even though it is a traditional course, students like the delivery method (before and after COVID19). Here are two comments from students on the end of the semester teaching evaluations: ""What a great course! I had come into this course with a prior love for physics from high school and horror stories of college physics. I understand the horror, but the fun and newfound knowledge definitely outweighs the nastier parts including equations. This course rekindled my love for learning. I had never been so proud to show my parents how I could calculate the torque, final velocity, and possibly the angular momentum of something under super specific conditions. MMP and Written HW were components that I used to check my learning after a week of classes--that system was very efficient and productive for me. The individual and group quizzes were also really helpful. I was wary of the group ones, but I found myself studying harder so I wouldn't let them down in case one of them couldn't study. Exams were hard, but they weren't completely foreign. All in all, this was a really fantastic course that definitely requires TIME for studying, but each one of those hours is so very much worth the time put into it."" and comment 2, ""What an awesome instructor. I found myself comparing my other professors to him. The material was difficult, and memorizing some equations/constants/mathematical relations could easily be grueling, but he made it anything but.

I eventually figured out how to set up break-out rooms for the in-class activities that we used to do at our 9 person tables, but it was very awkward to visit them in Microsoft Teams. In talking with my student advisees (I have about 20), the quasi-synchronous way that most faculty in our department adopted was more popular (at least for this very odd semester) than the more fully online approaches that other departments tried. The diversity of different approaches that they got across departments was confusing to them. Our faculty are preparing to go more online for fall, especially with lab materials and demos (which did not transition well to the distance learning format)."

Most of my prep time was not spent on the class I responded about in the survey (highest-enrollment one, a lecture), but rather on figuring out how to run our lab class remotely.

I feel like we had so many people trying to help that it was counterproductive. From my associate dean ""trying to help"" by changing course fees in ways that we had to undo, to Inside Higher Ed publishing uncountable numbers of ""how to teach online"" articles... like, can you imagine showing up to MIT as a freshman and having every single physics professor on campus come by your dorm room telling you how to learn physics all at once? Individually they may be brilliant and insightful and helpful, but all together you just have to shut every one of them out and ignore it all just to get by.

As for the results, it's confirmed my opinion that online sucks. Even done right, as I'm prepping to do in fall, it just sucks. The connection with students just isn't there, and all the messages, discussion boards, and Zoom office hours in the world don't change that."

We slowed our tempo a little, and were more generous with small issues like late homework, but there were not many. 

HW: Homework was scanned and submitted online pre and post transition. No change. We slightly reduced the difficulty and length after transition due to loss of good study sessions (below)
EXAMS: 1st midterm was evening, in-class.  2nd midterm and final (post transition) were done same time scale, online (using the same scan method as homework.) Students ""Zoomed"" in so we could communicate during the exam (and see them). Went smoothly, no indication of cheating, no complaints, few issues. 
We use ""2-stage"" (group) exams pre transition, but decided to lose that after transition. 

LECTURES: Lectured MWF@9 AM. Lecture capture system is in the room for after-class viewing available all term.  Continued to lecture via Zoom,  (continued after transition, I was able to go in and use that same room, so Asynchronous videos were same as before) Live attendance dropped significantly, by on average a factor of 2 after the transition. Students' viewing of lecture capture videos increased somewhat from about 20% of my students  regularly viewing to about 35%... 

CLICKER QUESTIONS: Stopped after transition. Asked the questions during live Zoom, but little student interaction (just responses on Zoom chat) 

IN-CLASS SMALL GROUP ACTIVITIES: Typically had one (or two) 15-20 minute activities/week before transition. Completely stopped after transition.

STUDY-SESSIONS: We had 3 hrs/week of staffed study sessions in the building. Pre transition about 30% of the class came. Post transition we continued via zoom, but only a handful (5%) showed up regularly.

Student evaluations were extremely strong, they liked how we did it. But, only half the students evaluated! 
I lost about 5% of my class (dropped) after the transition, more than usual. 
No more students than usual failed (just a couple). Students could opt for P/F after the final, I don't know how many chose this, it goes through the registrar's office. But our grade distribution was similar to past terms, with a small number (5%) of D's and F's."

I'll probably try to do that for the upper-level class I'll be teaching next semester, if we continue with online instruction. 
We were already using Gradescope to grade exams, but we switched to using it as a homework- and exam-hosting platform as well.

Have already lots of handouts and tutorials for this class, which I now posted instead of distributing on paper. I already posted lots of resources  in canvas during the face-to-face time, so students were used to going online regularly. Homework (MasteringPhysics) was already online as were the readiness assessment tests.

Besides the course, I teach the associated lab and a Supplemental Instruction course for the same students, so I have a lot of contact and I knew the students from last semester. The established learning community feeling helped keeping students engaged. I used all my courses as entry points: SI and labs used breakout rooms so there was still small group interaction. I already used online readiness assessments which allow students to ask questions and me to connect one-on-one with them. I put in a lot of my time (from the announcement to go online up to the end of the semester), but the transition was fairly smooth for the students. I am proud I did not lose anyone in this course.

Challenge was to design exams that can be administered online; I do not believe in online proctoring (there are still many ways to cheat and it intrudes privacy). My normal exam style questions include many free response questions with sub-questions, which I felt do not work online. I am not satisfied with multiple choice exams, so I needed to be creative.
 I missed an online option for clickers (had I-clicker before). Zoom polls do not record who responded how.

I love teaching face to face and I am old fashioned in that I don't use online HW or tests, so I ended up grading a ton of stuff that each student sent to me online.  It's way too much work, but worth the sacrifice to give the students what i think they need.  I filmed video lectures in rapid fire so that they would have those to watch.  I will do it again for Physics II (majors) and Stat. Mech. for this fall.  I'll have to use virtual labs this fall.  We had finished most of the labs in the spring course face-to-face, and I just said the hell with the rest of them because they aren't all that great anyway.  The poor students looked so demoralized in the Zoom sessions (used to help them solve physics problems)."

It's not possible to assure academic integrity in online courses that use endpoint examinations (known workarounds are widely available for defeating proctoring software). As a result, I am trying to transition to more authentic means of assessment, such as recorded video presentations with Q & A, etc. Kits from Hands on Labs (HoL) would have met my learning objectives for labs, but HoL production bottlenecks and added student costs took them off the table. As a result, this summer, I will try conducting synchronous labs from home. Students will be responsible for specifying the parameters of my experiment runs (e.g., how much mass they want me to add to a cart, etc.). Not sure how this will go. I think it will insure engagement. Will try to make it fun - I've enlisted my wife to be my lab assistant!"

I also posted the notes I went over in class each day, plus supplemental videos on concepts we were covering. 

Even though I'm at a MSI (with 2/3 women undergraduates), most physics classes remain predominately white and male. In general, my white male students continued to perform well in the course after the transition, while many of my women students and students of color struggled due to lower levels of privilege and access; e.g., to high-speed internet, time to devote to classes due to being ""essential personnel"" with increased work hours, family care obligations, and loss of in-person help at office hours. I fear this pandemic is going to disproportionately set back minoritized students, leaving a mark that continues the inequity and lack of representation already seen in Physics."

It combines traditional mathematics instruction (lectures, discussion sections, written weekly homework) with complementary scientific programming in Python (two intro interactive lectures, weekly Jupyter homework). The programmatic part was already provided through a course JupyterHub server and we already used Piazza for class discussion and a simple HTML website which I maintained for assignments, lecture notes, etc. The only things we did to go online were: 
1. Switch to Zoom lectures (recorded for those in different time zones) in which I asked students to either interrupt or use the group chat to ask questions/discuss and did 1-2 simple zoom polls per lecture.
2. Have homework submitted as scanned PDFs (we encouraged students to use camscanner or equivalent) to a Dropbox file request link. We marked up these PDFs with iPads to grade them and emailed them back out.
This worked fine.

The biggest problems:
1. Going to essentially untimed take home exams (24 or 48 hours) to accommodate multiple time zones meant that I had to write them to be hard to use the internet for cheating. This made them hard exams but mostly seems to have worked. Of course, we can't guarantee that students didn't get help but that's essentially impossible.
2. Peer-to-peer learning (eg. through working on homework together in the undergrad physics lounge, etc) is essentially lost."

Week 0, Developed policy, syllabus changes, and professor contact information. Adjusted calendar of class meetings and learning objectives for those class meetings (adding online responsibilities for students), sent a ""Changes to Course Number XXXX"" notice email to all students. Delivery technology beta testing (camera, laptop choice MAC or PC, bandwidth available at my home provided by Xfinity (Speakeasy speed test), and preparation of lecture materials for audio and video recording. Finally, I prepared 5 class sessions (scanned handouts-PDF, made notes to self to be more demonstrative in my voice delivery so to keep the attention of the students and typical review of lecture material prior to class).  These five classes were ""audio only"" lectures and to be delivered asynchronously. The purpose of the audio lectures was to meet institutional goals (ready to start online/remote delivery by Week 1) and to allow me prepare to add the video component for Week 2.  Week 1, students gained access through D2L and navigated to the News portal. Here they received a Power Point slide package for the day's lesson and my audio lecture. While students were signing on each class period and sending me questions (if any),  Also during Week 1, I was practicing and recording the lessons for analysis and mastering (what I could) a live delivery system, sharing PowerPoints, simulations, and videos for Week 2 delivery. AT this time, I made changes to my office at home and made a ""educational video studio"". The area needed to be a quiet place away from pets and people, neutral background, and comfortable because this is my classroom for the two months averaging 3 three classes a day. (Don't forget to have your coffee/water/etc. available.) After a few tries, I was feeling confident using Zoom and sharing other video components and ready to go live during Week 2. Week 2 had its challenges (not all students could do synchronous, students did not have handouts/observation lab sheets available, students needed ""handholding"", others were not engaged. During this time,  I performed many hours outside of class dealing with student's inability to manage the technology (connection speed, can't locate the lesson/lab, or simply not attending class). I went on a recruiting campaign to ask those, who were not attending, to return to class. Prior to my request, I only had 50% attending, after the request, 80%. By the end of the semester, 88% were attending, remaining students dropped the course. Week 3, the course dynamics smoothed and the delivery felt more face to face. The students were familiar with the  delivery system and were learning. I did notice a drop in median test scores from face-to-face delivery to online lecture/testing of +/- 10%,  (median= 82% to 75%) across all sections. I conclude this to be a case ""online student fatigue"" with those students taking more than one online course as opposed to students taking just one. I continued the Week 2 approach through the final week of the course meetings. I recently completed the semester and happy to decompress. I am sure I will reflect on this time and discover other revelations as my recollections become clearer."

We had to emulate the latter using Zoom breakout sessions.  The limitations of the system meant that I functioned as a traffic cop, steering assistants to individual group breakout rooms.  I was no longer able to devote any time to answering questions myself.  We ran a new separate section for students in an Asian time zone.  Fortunately, one of our assistants was also in such a time zone.  Providing a secure exam was a challenge.  I wound up using Qualtrics, with multiple choice questions delivered to students in random order and not allowing students to go back to a previous question. Extra problems were added to make up for the student not being able to go back, (which was bad on its own and also meant students had to worry more about time management). Students taking the exam were simultaneously logged onto a Zoom session with their mics on (but not video- too intrusive)."

Cheating: every method I have seen to prevent online cheating of exams, can be bypassed by a creative mind.
Multiple choice: I believe, takes away from critical thinking skills, when learning new material.
Excess emails: mostly due to either students not being able to get a face-to-face answer, students thinking I am a mind reader, and multiple emails have to be sent, since students do not send the information needed to answer their question."

I considered using respondus, but we were not allowed to require that students have webcams, and without recording students, respondus is too easy to get around (just google ""how to cheat with respondus"").  

For the Fall, we are again going with online instruction.  For an introductory physics course, I have no idea how to produce an exam which can accurately asses student performance due to the ease of cheating online, unless I were to spend an inordinate amount of time at it."

My preference was asynchronous Khan Academy-style lectures so that students with less internet bandwidth could still participate without missing anything, but I had enough people who wanted synchronous lectures that I found a middle ground. I record a 15-minute mini-lecture and post it for students to watch asynchronously, then we meet synchronously for about half the time we did before, where we still do the peer instruction with iclicker cloud software. Learning Zoom was a little stressful, but once I got it figured out I don't mind it so much. Feedback from students has been very positive. We finished one semester that way, and we're about 25% through our ""spring"" semester, which will be remote from start to finish."

The rest do not have the self discipline to learn physics by online courses.  My fellow faculty and I saw class attendance of online lectures drop by 75% after transition to online learning.  Also, about 35-50% of students simply stopped turning in assignments or taking tests.  It seems that without someone to hold their hands in-person through the process of learning, the majority of students at my school flounder.  This was true both in the introductory physics courses as well as the upper level undergrad physics courses.  Maybe it's different at R1 schools, but we were an R3 school reclassified as an R2 in 2018, so our student body may be different.  As an aside, I was very worried that my transition of my upper level E&M class to online learning this spring was horribly ineffective.  At the end of the semester I asked my students to fill out a COVID-19 response survey for extra credit.  Their responses indicated that my online course transition was among the best they had at the university.  I don't know whether to be pleased about this or worried again."

The main transition this semester was the creation of recorded video lectures as asynchronous replacements of, or supplements to, the synchronous classes that continued to be held. Planning, scripting, recording, re-recording when I messed things up, organizing, and posting with embedded questions of the videos resulted in something like doubling or tripling of the prep time for lectures.

Quizzes and tests were also difficult. Although I tried to do some things to reduce cheating, all of the questions on the tests ended up on Chegg. Because of the emergency nature of this past semester, I did not do a lot to pursue this academic misconduct."

The technology tools provided through the university (Zoom) has facilitated an easy transition to remote synchronous learning. The key features include the breakout rooms and built in screen sharing and whiteboard functions (with an appropriate drawing device). In my case, I open the zoom meeting on my laptop, which is where I control such things as participants and breakout rooms. I also join the meeting on an iPad, which combined with a high quality stylus, makes whiteboard work a breeze.

My experience has been that the transition from face-to-face to remote synchronous instruction has been pretty seamless. Furthermore, up to this point in our current semester, student engagement and performance is comparable to face-to-face classes.

The biggest concerns we have in our department are (1) how to incorporate laboratory type activities, and (2) the loss of the peer support structure among upper division majors (our department has a dedicated majors room where a lot of collaboration on coursework and positive socializing takes place)."

My at-home technical equipment was minimal and out of date (I did almost all my work from the office) but I was one of the fortunate few faculty authorized to come into the office for my Zoom sessions.  Talking to other users was by far the most effective form of help.  I finally settled on a simple but unsatisfactory method of writing out lecture notes and screen-sharing them as I lectured during my synchronous classes, and posting them afterwards.  Breaks for TopHat quizzes or to ask for questions produced almost no interaction, though almost all my class of 29 did join each session.  I converted my exams to take-home (never having done that in 40 years of teaching; that was an unfortunate learning experience as well).  The whole experience was profoundly disheartening, ineffective, and resented by my students.  My own incompetence contributed; I had virtually no prior experience with consumer electronics or social media at any level, and the students found that to be contemptible.   Whatever success I have had in my teaching career was entirely based on circumstances no longer in effect on line.  I took the opportunity to retire this July 1, partly to avoid teaching online in the fall.  (Though I might have retired then anyway, any wavering was eliminated by the prospect of an entire semester like the last few weeks)."

We had three days to transition to online instructions. I am one of the chalk-board types but learning new things wasn’t so difficult.  I used a web camera with Blackboard. I write on my paper pad and students could see that on their computers. After the first lecture, one student told me that he felt as if  he was  “sitting next  to you and watching you write on your pad”. There were more questions in this format than in the face-to-face instruction. I was also able to di some demos in realtime and at least they were able too see the results on a screen, again with the help of a camera. The closest ""online teaching” (felt like that)  I had done was lecturing to 360 students in UPII in a huge auditorium. I think overall it went well. I missed seeing student faces though, which provide valuable feedback on how well the lecture was going. The labs were the real loss. Cant make holograms or do polarization or spatial filtering online. We had to convert the remaining three (fun) labs to just reports."

I was able to use these videos rather than making new ones, although I still had live Zoom meetings in which I did new examples.  I uploaded the videos to Panopto and integrated the Poll Everywhere questions so that the video paused for students to vote just like they were in the classroom.
3.  The labs were the most difficult adjustment.  We had zero videos ahead of time, so I frantically tried to make recordings of our apparati before classes resumed.  Learning Adobe Premiere Pro was a lot of work, and dealing with large files was difficult to do from home. 
4.  I discovered that there still are not enough online physics simulations, and the ones that do exist do not use the same approach as me.  I guess I need to learn how to make interactive simulations on the web."

I have used simulations for some labs but they are not adequate for every physics lab, students need hands-on training with equipment and face-to-face time with instructors. Lecture notes do not substitute for live lectures and problem-solving sessions. The few times I've tried to record videos the files become large and cumbersome or there is some glitch, not to mention I do not have  a soundproofed, interuption-free place to make decent quality recordings.

The class was on aerosol and cloud physics with the first half on aerosol physics, the 2nd half on cloud physics.  I taught the 2nd half on cloud physics that began at the beginning of lockdown."

I have learned a lot about doing online.  I don't see how it is possible to do assessment in any meaningful way with an online course. Instead I think the right model is the freely available MOOC, break the material up into small segments and gave exercises or interactive problems between the segments.  The student can only proceed when they have mastered that segment, and the only ""grade"" is getting to the end.
However that brings into question the way Universities are funded from tuition.  It would be more honest to pay us for what we really do, scholarship and research and have the teaching free"

The impossibility to do think-pair-share, peer-to-peer instruction, and many other student engaging techniques made my class more of a traditional teaching style, which I dislike because it's inefficient. Interactive engagement is imperative to Physics teaching. Over Webex sessions, I could tell that some students had other ""occupations"" and they were not paying attention to class. Others signed in but were not ""really attending"". Other did not attend at all. E.g. one student dropped from A-student from before COVID19 to C-student level in just 5 weeks. The amount of EXTRA time I had to put in (besides 6 hr. contact class time and 2 hr. study session weekly) to get the students at the same level was beyond expectations. towards the end I started keeping score: in the last 3 weeks of class I spent extra time as follows, week#12: 12 hr 20 min; week#13: 3 hrs; week#14: 11 hr.  The number of emails I answered and the number of GroupMe text messages I relied to to keep the students engaged and focused are not included above, but they were another burden of the unfortunate Physics online teaching. Not to mention that cheating can't be controlled. With online teaching I cannot guarantee the quality of my assessment. Even with Lockdown Browser and Respondus proctoring system, some grades were a higher then expected... but that's what it is."

The shutdown came during spring break, which meant I had about three days to figure out the remainder of the five weeks left in the semester.  The work in groups I used the Zoom breakout rooms to put students together for group work on shared whiteboards.  I wrote online simulation based labs to make up for the ones that we would have done in person, and allowed students the option of submitting their lab reports themselves, but also meeting at the normal class time (I estimated about 1/4 of students attended the videoconference for the labs).  Tests were submitted online, and I chose not to use strict proctoring like Honorlock.  Grade results for the remaining exams were not very different from previous in class semesters, so if there was cheating, it was fairly ineffective.  Exams were submitted and then marked up using Canvas' annotate feedback tool.
Overall, except for the students who for some reasons simply never attended class again and did not drop/withdraw, the whole experience worked ""enough"".

I did end up scanning a lot of documents to PDF for one of the classes where I was a teaching assistant, and set up a Discord channel for the students of the class.  I'm not sure the professor did much for that one, beyond providing the scanned notes.  

he other class I was TA for during the spring transitioned to online using blackboard and pre-recorded lectures.  The homework changed to blackboard assignments/quizzes, and the labs were moved online by way of providing the students with video and photographs of the experimental apparatus in use, so they could make their own measurements.  From what I heard it didn't always go well, and some students struggled working on their own.  

This summer, I am teaching one of the introductory physics lecture courses.  The class is completely online.  I'm using Zoom to do lectures at the normal time the class would meet if it were still done in a classroom on campus, and use the screen sharing features to use an art program as a virtual whiteboard (I have a tablet, so writing is quite easy this way).  I record my lectures and post them online in case a student misses a lecture, although I do still expect them to attend them live whenever possible.  

For the homework, since the overall summer class enrollment is relatively small, the students are working assigned problems by hand and uploading the scanned work to Blackboard to turn it in.  The tools available to me for grading work handed in in this manner are less than ideal, but I do prefer the approach of handling things as much like an in person class as possible.  I administered the first exam (the class is still ongoing) as a test in Blackboard, with most questions as essay questions so the students could show their work by typing it in.  This did not go over as well, so I will probably explore ways for the students to just provide their own handwritten work going forward.  

I think the labs for the summer courses are following the style from the end of last semester.  The lab coordinator takes pictures and video of all relevant measurements and the students are expected to use them to sort of do the lab on their own.  Labs have three Zoom sessions a week where the lab instructors can speak with the students and help them with any questions.  We have encountered some issues with the photos and other information for lab (provided in a folder on google drive) not being organized well, and are working on improving it.  An unusual issue we encountered for lab is that the lab coordinator used a color coding system for the masses added to a hanger in one experiment, so students would need to ""read"" the total mass based on colored tape on each mass.  One student is colorblind, so that method had to be abandoned."

A positive side was that absolutely every student joined the on-line synchronous class, while some students would miss face-to-face classes; but my impression is that it happened because it was a way to find a ""real life"" community during the COVID-19 crisis, i.e., my impression is that this may not be the case for on-line classes in regular times."

I desperately needed a personal consultant who could make technology recommendations and answer my questions about what various technologies would and wouldn't do--and my university provided no such consultant. Moreover, I didn't want to impose stringent technical requirements on my students on such short notice. So I just kept things as low-tech as possible, telling students to read their textbook and then type questions in online discussions. I learned that many of them find reading distasteful.

I've also had a similar experience with transition to online labs... many students wrote in their evals that they need to see and get their hands on the equipment to understand it.
Online learning works well for too few people to replace live instruction.
Go back to meeting in person and make online a ""last resort only"" strategy.

Zoom breakout sessions work reasonably well with the ISLE approach I've used predominantly and most activities only needed to be modified slightly, often in the form of videotaping demos and labs. There were of course issues, particularly around time management and adapting labs for a video format. Some worked well enough, others not so much. Also, some students experienced tech problems, as did I from time to time. All that said some students tended to become more involved with the online format. The pros did not outweigh the cons in my mind and I don't particularly look forward to doing this again in the fall, except to say it is looking like the safe thing to do. I don't want to put myself and others at risk for the sake of having them drop a coffee filter rather than make measurements off a video. Mostly what I need to prepare is simply more time, although I also will try to improve on managing the sessions productively and try out ideas around making the labs asynch."

(2)  Your questions focus very much on modern technology.  Besides slides in PPT, nearly all my lectures were on paper with an old webcam showing everything I derived or example I went through.  Better than any fancy gaget (if I can fix some problems with the autofocus).
(3)  The main problem in online teaching is two-fold:  It is much harder to judge students' comprehension even in small-group breakout sessions, and most importantly performing equitable tests. The latter is really the main challenge as I go into summer teaching."

I have discussed this with other TA's who are similarly frustrated with the unprecedented situation but online teaching is not taken seriously by students on average.

We made videos of each of the experiments they would have done in person and provided those via our LMS. We did not have great discussions on Zoom as it was too easy for students to not turn on their video and remain silent. We felt blind as the visual clues we had so relied on were not available via Zoom. Teaching a guided-inquiry style course on-line was do-able but we would need to work hard on getting the same level of interaction that we did in person. Online assessment without cheating was hard. We had a large number of students upload our final exam questions to Chegg which we caught. We hadn't realized that they could get real-time answers to uploaded questions.

We used MS Teams, on the recommendation of my institution, to meet synchronously every lecture. I used the files function to upload updated syllabus, general and project information. I used the chat window to get students to answer on the fly questions, making sure they could write an answer down and then all submit simultaneously to reveal answers - a little like clicker questions. Overall, the learning gain through the semester was a little higher than previous face-to-face delivery of the same course. Statistically that might not be significant though given the size of the group."

My greatest concern in all of this, however, is grade inflation and lack of ability to do in person lab exercises.

As an aside: online education does not in any way, shape, or form work.  Khan Academy, youtube, etc. are not substitutes for in person instruction.  Anyone who thinks online education is the way of the future doesn't understand what education is and should lose their job."

That quickly fell apart as I do a lot of in-class collaborative work with the students working in groups of 2 to 3. The other issue is that my students had to struggle with both tech access (both computers and wifi) and time shifts with both work and home pressures. Within a week about a third of my students went asynchronous and just watched the Zoom recordings. 
I used Canvas extensively to add videos of lecture demos and to provide links to physics applets. In future I would plan to make exams/quizzes that directly tie into these applets. 
The biggest transition for me was going to all lecture format with only some student feedback via Chat. I tried various polling programs but the tech issues with the students all having different systems was too much of a disruption rather than a help, plus, a third of my students were not live anyway, so polling (sort of ""clicker style"" questions) seemed somewhat pointless. 
The biggest misery was exams. I'm certain that cheating was prevalent. On the simplest level, the exam averages went from low 70s to upper 80s. I also had to spend extensive time rewriting my exams so that they could not be simply Googled to find complete solutions."

We were using Turning Technologies for our exam polling software and, due to a huge wave of cheating in 2 classes on the first ""online"" exam, we had to switch to the Canvas LMS system for the Final Exam.  Our results were much more representative of in-class results from years previous, though cheating is still possible.
Even with our diligence in preparing exams, our department head was teaching a lower-level, 1-hour course required for physics majors.  In this small course, 75% of the students in the course joined a GroupMe where they shared the same ""wrong"" answers.   (They didn't realize that the answers were randomized!)  The shared results were easy to track in the small class and those students were given an F for the course and put on Academic Probation.  It is interesting that the leader of the cheating was due to graduate in the Spring 2020 and this course is only offered once a year."

My opinion is strongly on the asynchronous side, at least for lecture materials; I think the traditional lecture format translates very poorly to online/remote learning.

For asynchronous teaching, I strongly believe that dividing the material into smaller portions is useful; my lecture materials were recorded in 10-15 minute videos.  At the same time, I believe it is important to have *some* synchronous component, e.g. real-time chat, Zoom office hours, live examples in order to interact with students and give them the opportunity for immediate feedback.  The ability to have direct interaction with students is what can separate standard university remote classes from the MOOC model."

(I'm chair of my department, and I chose to teach a class that I could teach without a lot of new prep -- boy was I wrong!) Although my institution switched to a Pass/Fail system in which students have an option to ""uncover"" their grades, I changed the default grading rubric to provide the students with many more options (weight pre-covid work higher, submit a project in place of the final exam, or take an exam in place of a project, etc.) I switched written homework and in-class exams to online versions administered through Gradescope. At the beginning, I polled students to ask about their access to technology, their biggest concerns, etc. (Their two biggest concerns were: staying motivated, and integrity of exams. Personal health and safety was far down the list.) I made clear that we would proceed with flexibility, compassion, and generosity. I think it was a success, but I hope it's an experience none of us has to repeat."

In fact I believe that my lectures and labs  classes went really well and since I was recording the lectures on zoom, students had an advantage to watch them if they missed the lecture or want to review the topic again.

I had to modify my syllabus to remove the requirement that student teams present a homework problem in class every other week, making the homework grade entirely based on written solutions.  

Lectures: I used an iPad to share my screen and annotate my slides to include the content I would have put on the board like example problems and derivations. The prepared slides were a mix of blank slides with titles and slides with content.  The saved slides that I posted for my students included annotations and I also posted the WebEx recordings of the lectures to Canvas for students who lacked reliable internet or were unable to attend synchronously due to time zone differences.  The main aspect of lecture I missed was face-to-face interaction where I could use facial expression and body language cues to gauge student understanding. Also, the students seemed hesitant to ask questions in class when they were being recorded so I offered them the opportunity to ask questions via online survey in advance of the lecture to earn their participation credit.

Office Hours: I was also able to project my iPad screen on WebEx during online office hours to ""write on the board"" for students. Students sent me messages/photos via Telegram chat to ask questions about their work, allowing me to see how their solutions were progressing. 

Course management and grading: I had already used gradescope extensively for paperless submission of homework and grading so that transition was straightforward. I also already used Canvas for online reading quizzes and course management. 

Exams: The main challenge was ensuring the integrity of exams.  I allowed the students to pick the format of the midterm exams and they chose a 3 day take home exam which was open note and open book. The final was the same format, but with a self-imposed 3 hour time limit.  I am still not sure if they followed the time limit or the requirement not to consult the internet or each other, though I saw no direct evidence of cheating.

Student feedback: I offered several opportunities for anonymous feedback during the transition to online. In general, the students reported a positive experience though some reported internet access issues prevented them from fully engaging in the synchronous lectures.  The students who completed the end of semester evaluation gave the course an overall 4.75/5 rating, though they did acknowledge they understood the challenges I faced in converting to online and were likely more lenient than if the course had been planned to be online from the beginning. They also recognized that I was bandwidth-limited since I had an infant and school age kids unexpectedly at home."

Attendance rates at our asynchronous, drop-in Zoom+Slack help sessions were horrible. Assignment completion rates were bad, and students who did turn work in seemed to be merely going through the steps mechanically, as if looking for easy points and not actually engaging.

Word of mouth in the department and on campus is that this was a widespread phenomenon, not limited to this intro lab course."

But it is clear to me that this is not the correct strategy. Students learning remotely can't really interact in the same way as we did in our studio classes. Though young students are used to online interactions, they also keep some distance (privacy). 

So, a future online teaching course (on the Fall), will require some restructuring of the teaching that uses more systematically online tools of interaction. We have employed for example a LON-CAPA platform that gives good real-time feedback on the exercises. That's a good example of how things should work, I think."

The issue that arise from this the students access to  internet connectivity.  My courses already used the publishers website for homework and a third party polling app, both of which work fine when students have access to campus wifi.  Once they were dispersed there was no guarantee they could safely access reliable internet at the required times. I had to abandon the polling app, because I couldn't penalize students without internet.  Average attendance went from 70-80% to about 10-20% for the the synchronous lectures. Only one student contacted me via zoom for ""office-hours"" and the general interaction with student approached zero.  This approach entirely defeats the point of paying for a university education if the students end up just watching videos and answering a few questions from a text. I now understand the frustration my colleagues have with teaching online courses and teaching upper level courses to students that took the prerequisites online.     

Like many of us, I noticed the scores on the online midterm were much better than the in-class midterm.   However the scores on a final conceptual assessment were worse than expected, when compared with there online midterm grades.  Suggesting this mode of learning wasn't actually improving their understanding. Many colleagues at my university and other had issues with cheating through the Chegg platform, which made us question the validity of any of the online grades.

Every tool you add into a video lecture takes lecture time to use. Students are stressed and easily distracted by roommates or family. They feel that it takes longer to grasp concepts.  Students complain about learning in an environment that was a non-learning (fun) environment before and the dissonance they feel because of this. I learned that at risk students are put more at risk by remote learning. Students with some kinds of ADHD really struggle without the structure of coming to class.  I learned to communicate more and to open more lines of communication (even gave them my cell phone number so they could text).  I learned that we are all have to work as partners to make the class work.

It is much more difficult to get the students to interact with each other during the synchronous meeting times. I think this is partially due to technology (some don't have dependable internet, and few have the ability to write with a digital pen), but it is also cultural (they typically use the internet for passive consumption of information). I am also having an issue preventing cheating on homework and exams, whereas that's easier to prevent in a face-to-face setting. I like to do lots of demo experiments and make time to play with them and even allow students to interact with them. I've come up with some home demos, but not nearly as much. That said, this has forced me to make videos of the lecture-part of the class, rather than using some in-class time to do this. I can make this available asynchronously and use normal meeting times to work together on homework problems and tutorials. The biggest issue is students don't know how to get students to better engage and discuss with each other online - it's difficult to monitor progress in zoom rooms and organically switch back and forth between small and large group discussions."

We used breakout rooms rather than having students work together in small groups as we did in person. In a nominal 80-minute class we typically used 20 - 30 minutes for such activities.  In some ways, the students interacted with each other more using these breakout rooms.  Of course, one group did not hear what other groups were saying to each other, or hear their conversations with me.  That was a downside.  The more serious problem was that before the shutdown many students would work together outside of class, meeting informally in the atrium of the ""Student Learning Center"" (just a room with desks, chairs, and a coffee pot).  It *seems* there was less of. this done online."

Next largest challenge was the ""happy aren't we all doing well"" emails from senior administration that seemed to have no understanding of the very different experience of parents with young children.

Better to record lectures once for all, with the students accessing at any time, and then go for recitations in small classes, and to offer more office hours. 

The case of graduate instruction is different, and it would be preferable in this case to have face-to-face interactions is quite beneficial.

In any event we have to rethink this inefficient routine of going to class with notes and repeating every year the same stuff. Consider also that we could address a much large audience with online courses, which is extremely important since about one person each 10,000 in the world has a scientific education.

Another advantage of online classes is that people with disabilities, either instructors or students, can participate in the teaching and learning process in a much easier setting. I can envision for example that a brilliant instructor in a wheelchair can continue to work without any major issue, something impossible with the traditional approach. Same of course for students. 

It is also worth to point out the enormous reduction in CO2 emission if classes are taught from home, reducing to zero the commuting time and allowing more time for research, teaching, free time, and family."

Also, online tests with Respondus Monitor can be improved by use of wired WebCams that can be used to view a student's workspace rather than viewing the student's face exclusively.  I hope to be able to require that in fall."

I didn't anticipate how large the disruption actually was for students in terms of the patterns and pacing of the class.  Over the four weeks we were online in the spring I got more intentional about arranging deadlines to pace the work.  I thought giving more time was helpful but sometimes it wasn't if it meant that too many things were due around the same time.  Finding a pattern for lectures & associated ""in-class"" work, labs, and homework that was regular but spread the deadlines out was important.  I extended deadlines but I made students request extensions individually and tell me what was going on.  I granted them all for just about any reason, but I think they felt a lot better if they could tell me why and communicate their struggles.  This was a very different circumstance than a course that was online from the beginning.  Many of the lessons have more to do with a sudden and unanticipated transition and student stress than they have to do with online teaching."

For my 64-student gen-ed, I used powerpoint on Zoom, encouraged students to ask questions using the chat. I had four TAs available to supervise team-based activities once a week in breakout rooms. For breakout rooms, I first tried having supergroups where there was 1 TA/room with multiple teams in the room, but that did not work. I shifted to 1 team per breakout room, with TAs moving between a subset of rooms to check on students. There were numerous challenges, mainly to do with students being able to do modified lab-like activities in their homes - for some, this was not possible. I tried to make sure at least one person per team could do the activity, and then discuss it within their team. My one remaining exam was open-book, timed and delivered through the online system. Problems were grouped by topic. Once you opened a set of problems, you had to submit within a fixed time interval. However, the whole exam was available for 24 hours. Instead of a final, I had a paper and online presentations.

For my upper-level physics class, with 18 students, it was challenging to run a traditional lecture. I began by handwriting and uploading notes that I went through on Zoom - the students hated this, it went too fast for them. I tried purely writing on OneNote - too slow. The compromise was to handwrite and upload scanned notes before class, and then annotate them using OneNote. This worked better, but it was still hard for students to stay focused. Going forward, I would intersperse my lecture with short problems for them to do, do make the learning more active. I modified the exam to be take-home, open book, and to be completed within 48 hours.

What I took away from this experience, as a novice online instructor, but one who is comfortable with technology, is that each class needs to be tailored so that student learning outcomes are minimally affected, and are what you would like them to be."

We were initially persuaded by arguments of our colleagues that a lot of students would not be able to make synchronous classes, but we hoped a lot of students would show up for labs and Friday group work, but very few (less than 10%) did.  So students did these activities on their own or in self-organized groups.  This is an intro physics course for life science students, and our students are not as motivated as the engineering students, who did show up for group work.  So one of our big questions is what can we require, given such disparate circumstances. 

Our biggest concern going forward to the fall was using Chegg to cheat on exams.  This happened in all of our intro courses.  Exams were the biggest technical challenge:  how long of a window to give?  how to deliver the questions?  how to have students upload answers?

Generally, we didn't reorganize/rethink the course in any big way, we just used Zoom to carry on as usual, using breakout rooms for group work.  A lot of our work was on learning some details of Zoom and of recording lectures.  We also had just started to use Gradescope this semester, which turned out to be a lucky decision."

These lectures were given synchronously during the regular lecture time.  However, they were also recorded.  The recorded lectures and pdfs of the lecture notes were uploaded online and available asynchronously to students.  Homework was still do at the usual time, and given weekly.  The difficulty of the homework did not decrease, although I started adding extra credit points.  The 2nd Midterm and Final Exam changed from in-person exams to take home exams.  Hence, students had more time to complete them.  The homework and exams were posted on Blackboard, and the students were asked to upload their solutions onto Blackboard as well (although they were allowed to email the solutions if it worked better.)  Then their graded homework/exams were posted back onto Blackboard.

I would like to comment on synchronous vs. asynchronous.  We had a strong push at our institution to make everything asynchronous for accessibility issues.  While accessibility is a major concern, it is possible to solve this problem by being synchronous and asynchronous.  Dropping the synchronous lectures fundamentally misunderstands out students.  This is one reason I didn't like to our teaching centers, because I felt they did not understand the needs of our students and weren't listening to faculty.  Just like faculty did not sign up for teaching online courses, students did not sign up to take online courses and it's likely they never took online courses before.  Going purely asynchronous is a gigantic disruption in their learning, as they were getting kicked off campus.  There lives centered around the rhythms of campus and then that was taken away.  It was our responsibility as faculty to give as much semblance of normality as possible, and help keep their schedules.  Additionally, these students are not used to having to set their own schedules and to expect them to do such at the same time they are kicked off campus, the economy cratered, and there was a global pandemic puts undo burden upon the students.

So what I learned:  Try to keep things as much normal as possible, and as seemless transition as possible. Do not use a huge amount new technology that the students have to learn.  Set your expectations and communicate them early.  Also, regularly communicate reminding them about homework/lectures and telling them to take care of themselves.  Everybody understood that this was less than an ideal circumstance, and I found the students responded fantastically if you showed that you understand and care a little.  Finally, do not increase or decrease your expectations for the course, but give more avenues for them to improve their grades. 

I would also like to note in the end I passed everybody who did the work.  

A note about your questions: One of the questions asked how helpful different software were for teaching.  I answered ""very helpful"" for both of them.   I would like to note that Blackboard is generally helpful even for face-to-face, but something like Zoom is only useful for online teaching.  Also, there was a question characterizing Blackboard as ""new"" but I have quite a bit of experience using it, so it is not ""new."""

Based on class poll results, almost none of my students had any prior experience with video conferencing services like Zoom, however, so I did an in-class primer prior to the official online transition. I got a lot of positive feedback from students for doing this, but it would not have been possible to do if I had relied solely on the official university-wide communications regarding if transitioning was going to occur or not. I will mention that I have a lot of 'dependents' both professionally (e.g. research staff and students, etc.) and personally- and the online transition, even with my prior experience from research settings, was extremely stressful for me as a result, and I had to essentially halt all research activities (even though my research is computational in nature and can be done remotely by both me and my research group). I estimate I put in at least 1, 18-hour work day in addition to my standard workload for about 2 months in addressing student emergencies (or even just referring them to the appropriate campus office to contact). Many of which caused major access issues for them in being able to function in an online class such as lack of high speed internet access, getting locked out of the LMS for long periods of time, lack of access to electronic devices like laptops (so some only had access to smartphones for turning in work, accessing the class website, etc.), major upheaval due to life events like job loss, seriously ill family members, and in one case eviction during a stay-at-home order. So it is super important to incorporate inclusive methods in online course design and implementation! As an instructor, I also did not feel particularly supported by my department during this experience, so I sought and found more support online (sometimes starting on twitter) and from reading blogs, etc."

We had to completely drop their group projects because they were impossible to do remotely. Because our class was working closely together in small groups before we disbanded, and we all knew each other well, I think it went fine. For larger traditional content classes, I think the most important thing will be to form these small groups study groups and have them form contracts with each other on how they will contribute and be responsible to help each other learn. For our group projects, before disbanding, students had to rubric/checklist they used to evaluate themselves and their group members at 4 points in the semester. I think this would be a good thing to implement in a study group or lab team, to make sure they have a learning community if they are remote.

My comment about interviewing which I couldn't add below: I'd be happy to discuss teaching (I LOVE talking about teaching), but i don't know how helpful it would be since my seminar class was not challenging to move online."

We had few cases we suspect of cheating on the final exam. That one thing makes me proud but the method we used was very labor intensive. We will do something different for the fall for tests but I don't know what it is. 
The university encouraged us to be flexible with students as their internet may not have been good at home and they may have challenges - this meant we eliminated the attendance requirement for synchronous attendance. A large percentage of our team posted pre-recorded (by someone else) videos of content for students to watch and hosted some ""class time"" in person. Attendance was tiny. Students disengaged. Homework scores dropped. Faculty were discouraged by having to talk to impersonal ""black boxes"" on a screen that didn't even have student photos! And, in a class where the typical attendance would be 100 - less than 40 would attend the live sessions. My personal live sessions never had more than 10 students. We want to focus on flipping the classroom for the fall and being intentional about using breakout rooms for student engagement for the lectures. 
We did keep one component of the course ""synchronous"" which was our small group work sessions led by TAs. We doubled the TAs and used Zoom whiteboard and annotate feature. We are unlikely to have enough staffing to maintain that for the fall. 
For spring - we continued using WebAssign. Ramped up using Moodle to share videos and to do testing. Right now - in summer - I am testing Gradescope and Respondus monitor and will make a proposal to the faculty about testing plans for fall within a month."
