I knew I had to limit my class prep time, which was a factor in my pedagogical choices.  I think it also made me particularly sensitive to similar challenges my students faced.  I saw too much focus in many of my colleagues on maintaining standards and preventing cheating and not enough on having some human compassion because our students are going through a lot.  I am creeped out by Respondus.  Students did not sign up to be video taped, let alone for a prof to change policies and mandate that they be video taped in their own home.

We have been teaching with a fully hybrid flipped classroom for years where the only difference between a f2f and online class is whether you're physically there or not. All resources, homework, and support were available online before this hit. We even had our online, hybrid, and f2f students attending the same synchronous lectures, interacting in breakout groups in a mixed form. We've had the option to attend or not by creating asynchronous assignments for a couple years. Our vision, which we've been working towards for about 5 years, was to offer a completely al carte model where you pick this week if you're going to attend lecture, lab, or recitation in person or engage remotely. We form groups to maximize diversity across all chosen paths.  For our class the transition was fairly smooth. The one place it has been difficult, and we are failing our f2f (remote) students, is labs. We have physical labs for the online students but those kits are expensive and take time to prepare so we didn't go that route for our f2f students who moved to remote learning. They are using simulations and there is evidence that they are not working as well as the online students who are doing physical experiments.","* Note: After designing a fully online series I’ve came to the conclusion that almost everything on this list is just as relevant to your face-to-face (f2f) classes. I did not add a number of things, like backward design or the importance of metacognition, which I think would be considered already a best practice in f2f classes. If I added something like that here, I tried to highlight what about that practice is implemented different or more important in the online setting. 



Effective Practices

1.	Flexibility
a.	Due dates
i.	Not only an assignment here or there but even for systemic changes for individual students. A student may be in the field for multiple weeks, unable to engage at all, but when they return they can focus more intensely. 
b.	Engagement modes
i.	I cover this more in the section Multi-mode learning
c.	Assessment – Providing a number of ways to engage also means providing a number of ways to assess. Some students may be able to make synchronous group meetings or lectures while others are not. Allowing them the ability to engage and be assessed in multiple different modes ensures the flexibility required for distance learners.  
i.	Participation
ii.	Labs
iii.	Homework
iv.	Exam types
v.	Exam delivery methods
d.	Cheating – I didn’t know exactly where to put this but since increased flexibility can result in more opportunities to cheat, I put it here. 
i.	Most students are opportunistic cheaters, meaning they set out to cheat, they just found an opportunity to do so that is easy. Small policies and practices can go a long way to prevent the majority of students cheating. 
1.	Have students sign an honor code for every high/mid stakes event. Make them read it each time by planting a unique statement that must recall before signing. 
2.	Consider removing all high-stakes events. The reward has to outweigh the risk.
a.	It’s also much hard to systemically cheat many smaller events (quizzes or exams). 
3.	Consider using physical proctoring centers. This is the most secure but may create additional cost for the students and extra organizational work. 
4.	Consider online proctors like ProctorU. There is a gradient of security. On one end you have systems simply recoding their cams for you to watch later. On the other end the system completely takes over the student’s computer and there must be multiple cameras connected. A human may be watching live. These services can be just as costly as physical proctoring centers. 

2.	Multi-mode learning opportunities (maybe this belongs under flexibility)
a.	Synchronous – PER supports a number of models that all include some form of guided peer learning. Students work in groups with instructional staff available to guide the work and discussions. Studio physics is one example. This is more effective in real-time. I encourage departments to offer more real-time engagement opportunities as it is more efficient, more effective, and helps foster community. Students feel more supported when they can talk with their instructors and peers. These sessions should not be required and/or alternative asynchronous options should be available to students that can’t guarantee their schedule. 
i.	Many activities are well suited for a synchronous virtual classroom
1.	Studio-style problem solving sessions
2.	Group lab work
3.	Recitation-style smaller classroom sessions
4.	Real-time tutor support
b.	Asynchronous – Part of being flexible for students with non-traditional schedules means offering Asynchronous options and/or facets of your course. If these are alternatives to synchronous assignments/events they should provide as equivalent an experience as possible. 
i.	Some work can be better suited for asynchronous engagement 
1.	Homework – largely already implemented asynchronously
2.	Larger/longer projects
3.	Peer review of homework, lab reports/notebooks, exams, etc. 
4.	Reflective and meta-cognitive writing
c.	Blended/hybrid
i.	The benefits and best practices shared here can also be relevant to traditional students. I encourage replacing/supplementing some traditional learning time with online activities. Flipped classrooms where content delivery is moved online is one small example. Be careful not to simply add work. If you want engage students in an online activity, consider removing some other component. This could be removing a lecture to carve space for the new mode of work/collaboration. 
d.	Project-based
i.	Taking class online can create new opportunities such as longer/larger project-based activities. These tend to fit students who need asynchronous activities but it doesn’t only have to be asynchronous. There can be both synchronous and asynchronous aspects of the activity. It can be group/team based and those interactions can be in real-time or spread out of many days. It’s important to make both options available and try and form groups based on preferred engagement method. 

3.	Organization
a.	Clear roadmap – Without regular f2f meetings with peers and instructional staff, online students need everything to be more organized and clear. Distance learners tend to engage with class resources such as the syllabus more frequently. If the path to mastery is not laid out clearly, they have a harder time navigating the curriculum.  
i.	Calendar – centralized and integrated with learning platforms wherever possible. 
1.	Consider having one page (or calendar) with links to all assignments, study resources, and learning platforms. Organize by clear compartmentalized learning modules in a chronological order. Students tend to not draw boundaries based on content but rather by time. Even if you design to natural content breaks, present the outline to students along timeline breaks, like weekly or biweekly modules. 
ii.	Compartmentalized modules – It’s important to break the class into small digestible chunks that students can use to plan their time more carefully. Having multiple weeks where the topic is covered by many chapters in a traditional textbook, and one large homework due multiple weeks later, leaves more room for students to unknowingly fall behind. 
1.	Weekly or smaller is preferred. I find two or three modules a week to be ideal. 
b.	Use of a Learning Management System (LMS) – Most universities have a campus-wide LMS that students use in all their classes. Leverage this tool as it is where most students are used to basing their classes out of.
i.	Every assignment, from reading, to homework, to lab, to even exams, should be setup as an assignment with a due date, even if they don’t turn the work into the LMS. This puts everything in one calendar and students use that for alerts on what is due. It’s fine if they then upload it to some grading software or something else, just as long as it’s in the LMS calendar.  
c.	Centralized platform for all links
i.	Online classes usually require a host of specialized learning software, especially in STEM courses like physics. Examples include: LMS, grading software like Gradescope, clicker software, online textbooks, Zoom, OneNote, homework systems like Masteringphysics, Peer-review software like Peerceptive, Excel, Tracker, Pivot interactives,… and the list goes on and on. Make sure all of those are organized and findable from one central location, like the LMS. Students express overload when there are too many platforms but that frustration is highly mitigated if there is a central location of links. 
ii.	Be wary of specialized learning tools creep. It can be tempting to use the best piece of software for every little aspect and in the end students are engaging with 10+ programs.
1.	Consider the length of the course when deciding about what platforms to use. If it is a single class, creating a high barrier to entry may not be worth it. If it’s a year-long sequence, and the plethora of tools is worth it, it can be more acceptable to expect the extra time to learn all of the pieces in the system. 
d.	Proper training on each software platform – don’t assume that because your students are distance learners that they already “get” software and computers. Distance learners tend to span a wider range of age groups and a wider range of technical knowledge than traditional students.
i.	Syllabus quizzes that block new content until completed at the start of the term can be effect. Along with questions that encourage them to read the syllabus, they can have tasks that help teach them the learning tools that are to be used in the class. Examples include scavenger hunts for content, requirements to login and register software, and even test runs on things like uploading lab/homework/exam assignments. Expect to spend extra time on this step with online learners to ensure stress is decreased during the term. Students struggling to upload an assignment because of technical issues experience high levels of unnecessary stress.
ii.	You might also consider a small training on file directory structure and consistent file naming conventions.  
e.	Notetaking/organization software – with everything in digital format it is important to encourage students to adopt their preferred notetaking software. Examples include OneNote or Evernote. 
f.	Tablet – physics requires solving questions by hand, typically with pen and paper. When everything is turned in digitally that results in an additional step to make a digital copy. Using a tablet skips that step and ensures the writing is still active content (unlike a static flattened pdf).
i.	Couple the tablet with something like OneNote and your students (and you) will be more organized. Consider publishing your homework, lecture templates, and other resources all through one platform like OneNote. 

4.	Budgetary considerations
a.	Instructional staff support per person increases – a common preconception is that online classes are cheaper to deliver. In reality the number of students that can be properly supported online by one instructor is much less then in traditional f2f settings. One way to understand this is when one student asks a question in a live lecture, the answer informs potentially hundreds of students that had the same question. Online these interactions tend to be more one on one this takes a tremendous amount of human resources. OSU’s Ecampus for instance, a distance learning program ranked in the top ten nationally, suggests a budget of 2 to 1. Meaning if a full load for an instructor in a traditional f2f class is capped at 200 students, that number would be 100 for online courses.  
b.	Everything takes 30% longer – I made up that number but almost every online teacher laughs and fully agrees. Online learning is not a path to efficiency. 
c.	Lab kit costs – If your learning outcomes for lab include hands on activities that require purchasing a prepared lab kit, those costs can add up quickly. This is of concern for the already heavily financially burdened student base. I can also be a problem for the department if they have foot the bill upfront before the students make their purchase. There are companies that put kits together but they tend to have very high overhead costs. 
d.	Online proctoring – Can be effective to reduce cheating but also costs the students significant money, upwards of $45 per event. 
e.	Open Educational Resources (OER) – If all the engagement is already online, I suggest going one step further and using digital OER to cut costs. The publisher’s textbook is not as valuable as most think and the majority of students do not find the resource useful and end up Googling things anyways. Stop the cycle, go OER. Okay that was my unabashed plug for OER… just as relevant to f2f classes  

5.	Community
a.	Creating a vibrant inclusive community where everyone feels supported and owns their role is the most important aspect of any class. This becomes exceedingly challenging in the online environment. You have to get creative and approach the issue from a number of different directions. This is your biggest challenge!
b.	Learning Assistants (LAs) and TAs – It is best to have a multi-level support system for your class that leverages the strengths of the various members.
i.	LAs provide near peer that is unique to any other role in the team. Students feel far more comfortable asking questions they feel could be perceived as dumb or invalid to LAs than to TAs and instructors. LAs can manage the professional social media platform and help answer all those little questions that tend to fill an email box. They can also help in a number of other ways such as: fielding questions in synchronous/asynchronous events, holding study sessions, providing formative feedback on assignments, organizing and facilitating group learning, providing non-class-specific support like directing them to other university resources, and general community building. I can’t stress enough the importance of their role in any class. They are best return on investment you can find in my opinion. 
ii.	TAs typically know the physics better but are farther removed from the students. They are often grad students that never attended UG at that institution. As a consequence they may know less about the life of their students than the LAs. Use TAs as the first line of defense on supporting physics content.  
c.	Professional social media platform – a digital study room where students can come together to ask questions that LAs, TAs, instructors, and fellow students can collectively answer.
i.	This can be a message board service through an LMS but the functionality of such systems can be limited.
ii.	One suggestion is to use a platform more ideal for this type of engagement. Something that allows spontaneous real-time audio/video conferencing. Something with integrated digital whiteboards. Examples include Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Discord. 
1.	Check that your usage doesn’t violate FERPA. Discord is so open it is hard to maintain privacy. But it is a platform many students are already on… 
iii.	It’s important to differentiate this from other forms of communication. One suggestion is to use the social media platform for physics questions and questions about the working of the class. Things that everyone can help answer so that the burden isn’t only on the instructor. Leverage the community. Other questions about grades or administrative stuff should still be left to email so that there is a clear record and privacy is maintained. 
d.	Communication – Students need to know they are supported and the first step in that process is open and clear communication. When everything goes online you quickly learn the value of small f2f interactions. These can still occur in the online environment but they looks and feel different.
i.	Availability – your students need interaction with peers and instructional staff. You must make these human resources readily available.
1.	Clearly stated boundaries are important as they serve as guidelines for students. State when each member is available and the best mode to connect. Be careful of boundary creep where students expect too much of your time.  If you have to miss that time, make sure that is communicated to your students as soon as you know your absence. When possible give an alternative contact such as a TA or LA.
2.	Consider a contract that both you and your students agree too. An example is that from Monday through Friday you will respond to any question within 24 hours. You could go even further and expect that during that same time period students are expected to check their messages (email, Slack, message board).
ii.	Checking in your students – it’s important to check on your students at the very least once a week. Consider a traditional f2f class that meets 3 times a week. That 3 times a week you “check in” on your students. It may not be in practice a meaningful check in but it feels like one to the student, especially when there is formative assessment (like clicker questions) associated with class. 
iii.	More is better than less – error on the side of too many announcements or check ins. 
iv.	Fun videos telling them you’re thinking about them – you need to humanize yourself to your students. One way of doing this to send little videos showing the human side of your life. An example is to take a short ~1 min video with your phone while your digging in the garden and to tell the students you’re thinking about them and all the hard work they are doing on their upcoming report or assignment. 
v.	Tone – with a lot of communication moving to text and/or video, spend extra time ensuring the tone of your voice is welcoming and inclusive. Many students already fear their instructors and they may read what you write to mean something you never intended. 
e.	Group/team learning – There is a gradient of collaborative work with groups on one end and teams on the other. I won’t try and define what constitutes team-based learning from group-based but ways that they can be differentiated are analyzing the scope/time of the project, how many people are working together, whether there are formal roles, and whether the people have/will develop lasting relationships. 
i.	Synchronous
1.	Virtual breakout rooms (like in Zoom) can be used to allow collaboration like that in a Studio Physics classroom. 
a.	Getting students to talk and contribute can be the biggest difficulty. Defining roles, like someone dedicated to sharing their screen with the content everyone is working on visible, can help keep communication flowing. 
i.	Other roles can be defined and those can rotate through students. Scribe, equipment operator (like in a lab), presenter, skeptic, are examples of roles.
ii.	LA/TA support can really provide leadership in these sessions. 
b.	Most digital whiteboards allow exporting the work as an image. 
c.	Students should have at the very least a computer with a camera and microphone. 
2.	Clear session objectives – everyone needs to know goals and what product they are to be producing. 
ii.	Asynchronous
1.	Can be inefficient but provides the most flexibility
2.	Time delay between replies can be problematic
3.	Can be an advantage for longer/larger activities

6.	Lab goals
a.	Experimental design
b.	Data analysis
c.	Communication skills
i.	Collaborating on experiments can be difficult asynchronously
d.	Inquiry-based vs. prescribed labs
e.	Physical experiments vs. virtual experiments
f.	Project-based labs

7.	Accessibility 
a.	I like this being a main effective practices even though it could fit under flexibility because it highlights the importance. If someone decides to use UDL guidelines to make an online course they are likely to realize how their traditional class could be more accessible
b.	Universal design for learners (UDL)

I eventually figured out how to set up break-out rooms for the in-class activities that we used to do at our 9 person tables, but it was very awkward to visit them in Microsoft Teams. In talking with my student advisees (I have about 20), the quasi-synchronous way that most faculty in our department adopted was more popular (at least for this very odd semester) than the more fully online approaches that other departments tried. The diversity of different approaches that they got across departments was confusing to them.

I knew that I was going to use Teams for synchronous lectures for my large intro physics class (54 students) with Top Hat to check on student understanding and to give them some practice with questions. For recitations, I figured out how to divide them into groups so that they could interact while working out problem on paper with TA support. That worked quite well on Teams. I used my TAs to proctor (and record) exams in breakout rooms on Zoom (which allows you to see a gallery of students better). That turned out to be less stressful for the students and more reliable than ProctorTrack (which suddenly shut down for several weeks partway through the semester). As with our face to face classes, we used our LON-CAPA online homework system for homework and pre-class assignments (as usual). We used the Creative Commons Open Stax University Physics as the textbook, as we have done for a several years. For Labs, I created Teams courses for each lab section and put the TAs in control of their section. Labs were a mix of videos of me doing the lab (these required the students to make readings of scales themselves from the videos) and PhETs (for situations like DC circuits where watching me do it would not be rewarding). The generation of the lab videos (and making sure that the closed captions were correct and accurate) was a *large* time sink (I was teaching the only section).

(Not to mention that many of these contradicted each other. And none included the useful info that my university _had_ a template for online courses I could have just pulled into Canvas.)

Most of my prep time was not spent on the class I responded about in the survey (highest-enrollment one, a lecture), but rather on figuring out how to run our lab class remotely.

I feel like we had so many people trying to help that it was counterproductive. From my associate dean ""trying to help"" by changing course fees in ways that we had to undo, to Inside Higher Ed publishing uncountable numbers of ""how to teach online"" articles... like, can you imagine showing up to MIT as a freshman and having every single physics professor on campus come by your dorm room telling you how to learn physics all at once? Individually they may be brilliant and insightful and helpful, but all together you just have to shut every one of them out and ignore it all just to get by.

As for the results, it's confirmed my opinion that online sucks. Even done right, as I'm prepping to do in fall, it just sucks.

While online was the right call, students were openly talking about dropping out (and some did drop out) because of the lack of face-to-face classes. We need politicians to understand that colleges are not like restaurants. It's sad if a restaurant closes during the pandemic, but restaurants close and open all the time. If a college fails, that's pretty permanent, and could leave an entire region without access to public higher education.

I think one of the primary things to understand is that students taking online by force are a completely different population than students who chose to take online before. So a lot of the ""best practices"" for online teaching were actually irrelevant junk, because they were designed for a different population.

topics but did only a few, due to lack of time. I teach very interactively in person, but found that quite difficult online.

Have already lots of handouts and tutorials for this class, which I now posted instead of distributing on paper. I already posted lots of resources  in canvas during the face-to-face time, so students were used to going online regularly. Homework (MasteringPhysics) was already online as were the readiness assessment tests.

Besides the course, I teach the associated lab and a Supplemental Instruction course for the same students, so I have a lot of contact and I knew the students from last semester. The established learning community feeling helped keeping students engaged. I used all my courses as entry points: SI and labs used breakout rooms so there was still small group interaction. I already used online readiness assessments which allow students to ask questions and me to connect one-on-one with them. I put in a lot of my time (from the announcement to go online up to the end of the semester), but the transition was fairly smooth for the students. I am proud I did not lose anyone in this course.

Challenge was to design exams that can be administered online; I do not believe in online proctoring (there are still many ways to cheat and it intrudes privacy). My normal exam style questions include many free response questions with sub-questions, which I felt do not work online. I am not satisfied with multiple choice exams, so I needed to be creative.

We all worked together to make the best of the situation.

I found it much harder to connect with the students I only knew from online instruction. Also the motivation of the students was lower in Fall 2020 and many seemed to have the intention of just ""checking the course off"" and having it done, rather then intending to actually learn. For example I had serious cheating issues in Fall 2020.

I will do it again for Physics II (majors) and Stat. Mech. for this fall.  I'll have to use virtual labs this fall.

The class is small (12) so I brought them back to campus after four weeks.  Normally there is a lot of interaction because we incorporate labs and problem sessions into the two hour thrice a week meetings.  Not in this case, however.  The distancing and mask requirements made doing labs almost impossible and the students barely interacted with each other during problem sessions.  The only advantage was I could lecture live (even though I had recorded every lecture ahead of time just in case) and the students could ""see"" each other live.  The main advantages to studio format were completely lost.  In a sense, I kind of regretted hauling them all back to campus, even though I know they didn't like Zoom.  As far as labs went, I preferred the virtual ones (and spreadsheet calculations they did on electrostatics) to the live circuit labs.  Why?  Your natural instincts take over when you teach for 30 years and it was all I could do to maintain distancing when I was helping them with labs.  It really wasn't worth it because it was more risk than it should have been.  This coming semester I have 16 in the class and there is no way I'm going to meet with them in a room on campus.  The Covid case count is too high and I'm 64 almost 65 years old.  I'm not taking any chances this time around.  I'll think about going back to campus if and when we all get vaccinated.  Until then, we can Zoom.  One perk about Zoom though, the students could Zoom with me any hour of the day if they had questions.....and they did.

The shutdown came during spring break, which meant I had about three days to figure out the remainder of the five weeks left in the semester.  The work in groups I used the Zoom breakout rooms to put students together for group work on shared whiteboards.  I wrote online simulation based labs to make up for the ones that we would have done in person, and allowed students the option of submitting their lab reports themselves, but also meeting at the normal class time (I estimated about 1/4 of students attended the videoconference for the labs).  Tests were submitted online, and I chose not to use strict proctoring like Honorlock.  Grade results for the remaining exams were not very different from previous in class semesters, so if there was cheating, it was fairly ineffective.  Exams were submitted and then marked up using Canvas' annotate feedback tool.
Overall, except for the students who for some reasons simply never attended class again and did not drop/withdraw, the whole experience worked ""enough"".  Not something I would choose to do, and somehow more work, but even those students I was most worried about (including those with accommodations) seemed to finish out okay.","In face to face teaching, my course used active learning where students would work together, in fairly close proximity to solve and present problems (so that they could explain their work to their peers).  Inevitably in face-to-face there would be cross-talk between student groups at the same table.  In teaching online I used Zoom breakout rooms which are completely separate, which killed all of that useful eavesdropping.  Student engagement was uneven to say the least, some students just wouldn't interact or unmute, and it was impossible for me as the instructor to assist unless groups asked for help.  Some groups wouldn't work together at all, and left before the end of class or completing the in-class work.  For substituting for their in class presentations, each group had to film a video of them going through their solution, which was a ton more grading.  There was a lab component for this course which was done with iOlab devices augmented with some simulations.  I made that asynchronous and every single issue of using computer data acquisition that we would have had in class, we had with individuals.

474,ae14bbea789e7c9ce96ba5671924467d2ae5ad33,"I found that a synchronous lecture using Powerpoint over WebEx allowed me to do almost everything I would have been able to do in my planned class except for student homework presentations, group work, and in-class exams. I had to modify my syllabus to remove the requirement that student teams present a homework problem in class every other week, making the homework grade entirely based on written solutions.  

Lectures: I used an iPad to share my screen and annotate my slides to include the content I would have put on the board like example problems and derivations. The prepared slides were a mix of blank slides with titles and slides with content.  The saved slides that I posted for my students included annotations and I also posted the WebEx recordings of the lectures to Canvas for students who lacked reliable internet or were unable to attend synchronously due to time zone differences.  The main aspect of lecture I missed was face-to-face interaction where I could use facial expression and body language cues to gauge student understanding. Also, the students seemed hesitant to ask questions in class when they were being recorded so I offered them the opportunity to ask questions via online survey in advance of the lecture to earn their participation credit.

Office Hours: I was also able to project my iPad screen on WebEx during online office hours to ""write on the board"" for students. Students sent me messages/photos via Telegram chat to ask questions about their work, allowing me to see how their solutions were progressing. 

Course management and grading: I had already used gradescope extensively for paperless submission of homework and grading so that transition was straightforward. I also already used Canvas for online reading quizzes and course management. 

Exams: The main challenge was ensuring the integrity of exams.  I allowed the students to pick the format of the midterm exams and they chose a 3 day take home exam which was open note and open book. The final was the same format, but with a self-imposed 3 hour time limit.  I am still not sure if they followed the time limit or the requirement not to consult the internet or each other, though I saw no direct evidence of cheating.

Student feedback: I offered several opportunities for anonymous feedback during the transition to online. In general, the students reported a positive experience though some reported internet access issues prevented them from fully engaging in the synchronous lectures.  The students who completed the end of semester evaluation gave the course an overall 4.75/5 rating, though they did acknowledge they understood the challenges I faced in converting to online and were likely more lenient than if the course had been planned to be online from the beginning. They also recognized that I was bandwidth-limited since I had an infant and school age kids unexpectedly at home.","In Spring 2020 I taught a primarily lecture based course which I had never taught before (in person or online).  In Fall 2020, I taught three courses which I had previously taught in person.  The prep for converting these three courses to hybrid/online was substantial and I would consider it to be equivalent to a new course prep. 

Another important aspect of my teaching in Fall 2020 which differed from Spring 2020 was that I converted an intro physics course which had been about 25% lecture and 75% groupwork when taught face to face into a hybrid or fully remote/synchronous format. Most of the faculty in my department did not attempt to reproduce the expectations for groupwork in online teaching of this course, but I decided to try.  I used breakout rooms in Zoom, which involved a lot of trial and error.  It would be great for there to be better documentation about how to use breakout rooms to best effect (e.g. how to assign breakout rooms in advance to keep group assignments the same, not opening the breakout rooms too early to prevent students from being unassigned, etc). Ultimately I believe that this format was successful and I had students tell me that the course was their best-organized online class.  

The biggest challenge I faced was integrity of exams.  Despite using the Lon Capa software to assign different numbers for all the students on the exam problems, there was clearly cheating occurring. I did not pursue this cheating with the honor council, but instead just to be very lenient with my grading for students who seemed not to cheat.  As a result, all my students in the intro class passed with a C- or above, which was the minimum allowed to have an opportunity to go on to the next course in the sequence.  Typically I have about 10-15% of my students in this course receive a grade below C-, requiring them to retake the course if they wish to progress. However, this semester I didn't feel confident penalizing students who failed exams because they refused to cheat when there was significant evidence of cheating among the others in the course.","{'neg': 0.08, 'neu': 0.773, 'pos': 0.147, 'compound': 0.9759}","{'neg': 0.035, 'neu': 0.891, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.9039}","{'neg': 0.08, 'neu': 0.773, 'pos': 0.147, 'compound': 0.9759}",0.9039,0.9759,0.07199999999999995

The issue that arise from this the students access to  internet connectivity.  My courses already used the publishers website for homework and a third party polling app, both of which work fine when students have access to campus wifi.  Once they were dispersed there was no guarantee they could safely access reliable internet at the required times. I had to abandon the polling app, because I couldn't penalize students without internet.  Average attendance went from 70-80% to about 10-20% for the the synchronous lectures.

It is much more difficult to get the students to interact with each other during the synchronous meeting times. I think this is partially due to technology (some don't have dependable internet, and few have the ability to write with a digital pen), but it is also cultural (they typically use the internet for passive consumption of information). I am also having an issue preventing cheating on homework and exams, whereas that's easier to prevent in a face-to-face setting. I like to do lots of demo experiments and make time to play with them and even allow students to interact with them. I've come up with some home demos, but not nearly as much. That said, this has forced me to make videos of the lecture-part of the class, rather than using some in-class time to do this. I can make this available asynchronously and use normal meeting times to work together on homework problems and tutorials. The biggest issue is students don't know how to get students to better engage and discuss with each other online - it's difficult to monitor progress in zoom rooms and organically switch back and forth between small and large group discussions.","The biggest difference was the preparation and expectations of the students. The students simply did not adapt well to the new format in the Spring, and in the Fall more of them knew what to expect. However, in both cases it was plainly evident that some students had more difficulties engaging with the material and participating in discussions compared to face-to-face settings. The two big hurdles I see are technological and psychological. Specifically, physics students need access to pen-based platforms (e.g., ipad or Surface) that they can use to write equations and sketch - this is absolutely necessary for introductory physics. We also need a better video platform that allows for more seamless and organic small group discussions - Teams and Zoom are terrible at this. Students seem much less self-disciplined and able to recover from failure, even when courses are structured to accommodate that.

For my 64-student gen-ed, I used powerpoint on Zoom, encouraged students to ask questions using the chat. I had four TAs available to supervise team-based activities once a week in breakout rooms. For breakout rooms, I first tried having supergroups where there was 1 TA/room with multiple teams in the room, but that did not work. I shifted to 1 team per breakout room, with TAs moving between a subset of rooms to check on students. There were numerous challenges, mainly to do with students being able to do modified lab-like activities in their homes - for some, this was not possible. I tried to make sure at least one person per team could do the activity, and then discuss it within their team. My one remaining exam was open-book, timed and delivered through the online system. Problems were grouped by topic. Once you opened a set of problems, you had to submit within a fixed time interval. However, the whole exam was available for 24 hours. Instead of a final, I had a paper and online presentations.

For my upper-level physics class, with 18 students, it was challenging to run a traditional lecture. I began by handwriting and uploading notes that I went through on Zoom - the students hated this, it went too fast for them. I tried purely writing on OneNote - too slow. The compromise was to handwrite and upload scanned notes before class, and then annotate them using OneNote. This worked better, but it was still hard for students to stay focused. Going forward, I would intersperse my lecture with short problems for them to do, do make the learning more active. I modified the exam to be take-home, open book, and to be completed within 48 hours.

What I took away from this experience, as a novice online instructor, but one who is comfortable with technology, is that each class needs to be tailored so that student learning outcomes are minimally affected, and are what you would like them to be.","Spring 2020 was spent in triage mode - trying out small variations till something worked reasonably well. Since then, Zoom has added features, and I have had the opportunity to learn from others how to engage students better. While most of the students were very happy with the level of engagement in Fall 2020, it still remains a challenge for some. It is hard to figure out how to modify in-class activities without spending excessive time on everything associated with running - everyone is tired of the excess amount of time everything takes. Finding the right balance between activities to check-in with students during synchronous sessions and having time for instruction without expecting them to spend excessive time to prep outside of class - findign this balance is the challenge most instructors face.","{'neg': 0.03, 'neu': 0.83, 'pos': 0.139, 'compound': 0.9259}","{'neg': 0.055, 'neu': 0.871, 'pos': 0.074, 'compound': 0.7218}","{'neg': 0.03, 'neu': 0.83, 'pos': 0.139, 'compound': 0.9259}",0.7218,0.9259,0.20409999999999995

Lectures became pre-recorded asynchronous, and we made the original lecture time a second lab section and split the students between them, in addition to spreading out the lab stations so that there was only one per room.  The class was already organized through Blackboard for distribution of course materials and lab submission and grading, so nothing there had to change.  Pre-recording and editing lectures was more time consuming than I anticipated, so I did not finish recording all of the material I'd hoped to.  I did try a discussion feature in Blackboard but it didn't result in more student interaction so I dropped it.  I did make a Slack discussion board with various channels, but the students also didn't use that to talk to each other and mostly used it to ask me questions, so it wasn't useless but wasn't what I hoped it would be.  I presume that they had other channels to communicate with each other that I didn't have access to.  Zoom for office hours and final presentations worked well.

We were initially persuaded by arguments of our colleagues that a lot of students would not be able to make synchronous classes, but we hoped a lot of students would show up for labs and Friday group work, but very few (less than 10%) did.  So students did these activities on their own or in self-organized groups.
